            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I preſent vnto your Exllency a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of both Churchs, vvhich a viper has endeauoured to byte, that the Catholick has bred in her boſom; to follovv the
<pb facs="tcp:41955:3"/>Truth (if vve belieue him) he forſooke all that vvas Deare vnto him, he might haue vſed that phraſe of S. Peter ſince that vvhat he had to forſake, vvas but <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke;</hi> but iuſtly may vvee think he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Your Excellency, as S. Peter had from Chriſt, a return of a <hi>Seat;</hi> not ſuch as Peter obtained, but as the children of Zebedee did pretend. But your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, vvhoſe Decrees are liuing Ecchos of the <hi>Royal</hi> ſentiments, vvill adiudge him rather a <hi>Chalice</hi> to drink, than a Seat to exalt him; a <hi>Chalice,</hi> I ſay, ſuch as the Royal Piety of King Iames preſcribed to thoſe of his blaſphemous opinion, in the meeting of his Clergy at <hi>Southampton: VVee deteſt in this point the cruelty of the Puritans, and iudge them vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of fyre, vvho affirm, that in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Religion a man may not be ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, all ſober men of both Religions deſire the execution of this ſentence, againſt this impious aſſertion, pronounced in your
<pb facs="tcp:41955:3"/>Excellencies hearing, and giuen vnto you in print (to profane both your eares, and eyes vvith a repeated blaſphemy) by a late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted from our Church, and that, not only for a reuenge of the iniury don to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in particular, in adiudging your Noble Anceſtors (vvho allmost all dyed in that Profeſſion) vnto Hell; nor for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning his ovvn to the like miſery, (if, for being of the ſimple ſort, he vvill not plead for their ſaluation) but for the iniury don to Chriſtian Piety, to vvhich that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is contrary in the iudgment of all learned Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>But vvhat makes this execrable Poſition vnpardonable in our Aduerſary, is that his ovvn vvords accuſe him to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his conſcience: pag. 116. he ſaies, <hi>Their Tenets are inconſiſtent vvith ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, though ignorance may haply excuſe many of the ſimple ſort, but not ſuch as knovv, or vvith due care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, may knovv their error.</hi> By this he
<pb facs="tcp:41955:4"/>exclues all VVyſe men of our Profeſſion from ſaluation, and affords it only to the <hi>ſimple ſort,</hi> or thoſe vvho haue an <hi>inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ignorance.</hi> That heerin he ſpeakes againſt his conſcience, its moſt apparent; for in his diſcourſe he often ſtyles <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> a <hi>Saint;</hi> the firſt Reformers, and Paſſionat Sectaries degraded the Saints of their Canonization, but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, as yet, retains the reſpect due to their glorious memory. VVhateuer he might ſay of others, he knovvs vvell that S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> vvas of the Roman Religion, a fryer of S. Dominicks Orders; None of the <hi>ſimple ſort,</hi> or that could be <hi>inuincibly</hi> ignorant, being vvell vers'd in Scripture and an Eminent Maſter in moſt ſciences; He belieued, profeſſed, and taught our Tenets of <hi>Real Preſence, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> He vvas then in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls iudgment a Saint reigning in Heauen, and at the ſame tyme is condemned by him to hell, becauſe he belieued and profeſſed <hi>Tenets inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtents</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41955:4"/>vvith ſaluation: is not this to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke againſt his conſcience?</p>
            <p>He had vvit, My Lord, to vnderſtand, he could not iuſtify his ſeparation from our Church, if in our Church there vvas not ſomvvhat, inconſiſtent vvith ſaluation: for to ſeparat from the true Church, vnder pretence of her being guilty of ſom errors, and of reforming her, by purging her from thoſe errors, if the errors be not quite dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and inconſiſtent vvith ſaluation, is ſo far from being lavvfull, that ſuch Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers cannot be excuſed from Schiſm: <hi>All things should be endured</hi> (ſaies S. Denis of Alexan. apud Euſeb. Hiſt. Eecl. l. 6. c. 25.) <hi>rather, than to conſent to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the Church of God;</hi> and ſaies Iren. l. 4. cont. Heret. c. 62. <hi>No ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Reformation can be made, as the Euil of Schiſm is pernicious,</hi> for if thoſe Errors be conſiſtent vvith ſaluation, then they are no neceſſary cauſe obliging to a ſeparation; the ſeparation from the
<pb facs="tcp:41955:5"/>true Church is Schiſmatical and damnable, vvhen there is no need, or neceſſary cauſe for ſeparating; conſequently, to ſeparat from the true Church for Errors vvhich are conſiſtent vvith ſaluation is a moſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Schiſm. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall felt, perhaps, the force of this conſideration, and to iuſtify his ſeparation from the Church vttered that horrid blaſphemy of errors in her inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent vvith ſaluation.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe, Your Excellency to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider vvhat an iniury he does to your cauſe in ſeeking to iuſtify it by an aſſertion ſo contrary to your Church, and ſo odious to your Excellencies Piety, <hi>That there is no ſaluation in the Catholik Church, That her errors are inconſiſtent vvith ſaluation.</hi> It's far from your Excellencies Piety to belieue that S. <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> admired by the VVord for his learning and ſanctity, vvas condemn'd to Hell, and yet he belieued and taught the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament:
<pb facs="tcp:41955:5"/>it's therefore no error inconſiſtent vvith ſaluation. Your Excellencie vvill not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is in Hell, vvho profeſſed and taught the Tenet of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, as appears in his Ench. c. 119. lib. 9. Conf. c. 13. and lib. de Haereſ. c. 53. vvhere he condemns <hi>Aetius</hi> as an Heretick, for denying ſacrifice should be offered for the dead. Purgatory therefore is no Error in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent vvith ſaluation: Your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vvill not patiently heare any man to ſay that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> is eternally damn'd, and yet he thaught the veneration and vſe of the ſign of the Croſs Epiſt. ad Dem. and the veneration of Relicks of Saints lib. cont. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil. S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> praied and exhorted to pray to Saints Hom. 43. in Gen. Hom. 5. &amp; 8. in Mat. and must vvee ſay that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is damn'd to Hell? Theſe are the Errors, vvhich M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall affirms to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent vvith Saluation; Theſe are the Tenets, in vvhoſe Profeſſion he ſayes, no <hi>VVyſe</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Man can be ſaued,
<pb facs="tcp:41955:6"/>impiously condemning to Hell the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, Saints vvhich the Chriſtian VVorld reueres for the Pillars of the Chnr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, and not only them but all VVyſe men Seculars and Eccleſiaſtick of all precedent ages to Luther, if inuincible ignorance did not excuſe them, vvhich they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, nor can vvee imagin they could haue, being the moſt learned Doctors of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>If this Treatiſe did contain nothing elſe but a check of this rash and impious aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it vvould not be vngratefull to your Excellencie; but had I left any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined of vvhat he treats in his diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, he vvould interpret my ſilence his ovvn Victory, and flattering himſelf vvith a fond perſvvaſion of the euidence of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvould think vnanſvverable, vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer vvere not anſvvered. And though he touches but lightly the Controuerſy of the Neceſſity of an infallible liuing iudge of Controuerſies; yet for the reſpect I ovvn to
<pb facs="tcp:41955:6"/>Your Excellencie I endeauour to fathom this queſtion: I ſay <hi>for the reſpect I ovv to your Excellency,</hi> for vvanting nothing to an accomplisht happineſs vnder your Ex<hi rend="sup">cy</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Gouernment, but <hi>Vnity</hi> of ſubiects in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> the greateſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation I can caſt on them, and teſtimony of my Duty I can exhibit vnto your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, is to shevv, by vvhat means vvee may attain to that <hi>Vnity;</hi> vvhich is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than a liuing infailible Iudge, from vvhom vvee are to receiue the true fence of Scripture.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Mens <hi>vvills</hi> were inclined to embrace the Truth, as their <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings</hi> are inſtructed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, wee might ſpare our labor in writing, and cut short the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Controuerſy Books that the world is glutted with. It's inclination is wanting to the <hi>vvill;</hi> not inſtruction to the <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> Nature prouided, the <hi>vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> should direct the <hi>vvill:</hi> That <hi>This</hi> should neither loue nor hate; but as <hi>That,</hi> should repreſent the obiect worthy of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or loue: but the malice of Man has prepoſterously inuerted this order: now its not the practice, that the <hi>vvill</hi> loue, what the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> knows to be good, but the <hi>vvill,</hi> byaſs'd by Intereſt, or other wordly conſiderations, doth incline, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner force the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> by the violence of our Paſſions, to adiudge for Good (let it be what it will) watheuer ſuits beſt with her depraued inclinations. Hence there are as many Religions in the State, as there are Intereſt's; that byaſs the Subiects; wee
<pb facs="tcp:41955:7"/>should therefore lay our pens aſyde; and by a conſtant addreſs of our prayers to God, begg his Grace for to reform the <hi>vvill,</hi> which with the cloud of her deſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Paſſions darkens our Reaſon; and leſſen our Tranſgreſſions, which ſtupify our minds: for certainly, it's not light, that is wanting in ſo learned an age; but ſinsabound which indiſpoſe our eyes to ſee it.</p>
            <p>But whylſt our Aduerſaries decry our Religion, with ſuch a ſtream of Pamphers, as floweth dayly from the Preſs; shall wee by our ſilence ſtarue our Cauſe, and make it ſuſpected of weakneſs, in giuing ſome ground by our muteneſs, to think it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be defended? or shall wee ſpare a little Ink to defend, what wee are obliged to aſſert with our blood? This hath moued me to write this Treatiſe; and that as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me receiue better nourishment from groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer meats, than from delicat fare; it may happen, that ſome one may meet with theſe lynes, and receiue more ſpiritual nourishment from them, though rudely worded, and in a plain ſtyle, than from the learned Treatiſes eloquently penned by others. Being <hi>a Debtor</hi> (with S. Paul) <hi>to the vvyſe and vnvviſe,</hi> I endeauor to
<pb facs="tcp:41955:8"/>ſatisfy, <hi>Them,</hi> with the ſtrength of my Reaſons; and <hi>Theſe</hi> by ſtooping to vulgar expreſſions, and ſometymes to Periods which might be well omitted, if only Men of quick Apprehenſions were to reade what I write, to open my fence to thoſe of common vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>What chiefly hath moued me to publish theſe lynes, was the diſmal fall, of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Andrew Sall; a <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> and a Profeſſor of Diuinity and Controuerſies, as he tells vs, all which qualifications, if true, makes his Reuolt from the Church more crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. He deſires he may be anſwered ſerious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſoberly ſetting a ſyde all bitterneſs, calumnies and railleries, all which he shall eaſily obtain of me, far from inſulting ouer any Chriſtian for his weakneſs; but rather drawing from it a caution for my own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety. I am not of the ſeuere opinion of thoſe <hi>ſeruants,</hi> who would pluck out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Tares, which budded in the field of Corn Mat. 13. but aduiſed by the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the field to forbeare with patience; <hi>zizania dimitti iuſsit,</hi> (ſayes S. Chryſoft. hom 30. in 9 Mat. <hi>vt poenitentiaelocus dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> He commanded the <hi>Tares</hi> should not be touched, that there might be tyme for repentance: Becauſe, as. S. Auguſ. ſaies
<pb facs="tcp:41955:8"/>ſerm. 46. <hi>etiam ipſa zizania ſaepe in triti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum mutantur.</hi> Perhaps that which now is <hi>Tare,</hi> may by the kindneſs of the ſoyle, and celeſtial influence become <hi>vvheate;</hi> which Experience hath often shewen to be a holſom aduice; wheras many that haue fallen, haue by Gods Mercy recouered, and by repentance been rayſed to a higher degree of Sanctity, than the Innocent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto, who neuer did fall. And if it be true (what he ſayes) that ſome haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed him with baſe calumnies, and laid ambush for his lyfe; I am ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing that practice that I think it an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of inſolency and pride, which blinds them not to conſider their own fraylty, and what they may be: wee ought rather to pitty his misfortune, and prayſe God, that has not ſuffered vs to ſplit on the ſame Rock: and ſince wee do not know, but that by Gods mercy, he may be reclaimed, why should wee vpbraid him Phariſee-ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, whom, for ought wee know, God has deſigned to make by a generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and acknowledgment of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſuperior to vs in his Glory?</p>
            <p>This iuſt moderation shall guide my pen; neither can M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall iuſtly complain that I exceed it, in letting the world know that
<pb facs="tcp:41955:9"/>he ſpreads too much his Talents and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in empty Titles, nay and ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ones. <hi>Profeſſor of Moral Theology in the Royal Colledge of Salamanca;</hi> no more than in withe Hall at London. <hi>Profeſſor of Controuerſies in the Irish Colledge of Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> and his Auditory compoſed of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards french</hi> and <hi>Irish.</hi> No controuerfies taught in that Colledge, nor has not been theſe forty years: and how vnlikly it is to be true, what he ſayes, may appeare, in that he ſayes his Auditory was compoſed of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> a People that cannot endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re any diſpute of the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, altogether ſtrangers to matters of Controuerſy: and of <hi>frenchmen;</hi> and it is as hard to find a <hi>french</hi> Studiant in the vniuerſity of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> or any other of Spain, as a Swallow in winter, eſpecially that when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall was in Salamanca, the war betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot, and lykly they muſt haue got a Safe-conduct to go to be Mr Salls Schollers. <hi>Profeſſor of Diuinity</hi> in <hi>Pamplona Tudela</hi> and <hi>Palencia in Spain.</hi> In the Colledges of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela</hi> and <hi>Palencia</hi> there is not nor was there at any tyme <hi>Diuinity</hi> taught: in <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plona,</hi> indeed he was Profeſſor of Diuinity, for one or two years; and had they been as
<pb facs="tcp:41955:9"/>content of him, as he was of himſelf, he would haue continued many more. <hi>Rector of the Irish Colledge</hi> he was; an imployment that requires no more than a mediocrity of diſcretion to gouern half a dozen Lads peaceably; and I know not was it a greater credit for him to haue been in that implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yement, than to haue been caſt out of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the yeares end, when others conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued it for three years at leaſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly for 6. or eight years. As for other things that might be ſaid, I will take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them.</p>
            <p>And euen from this moderat reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his vanity, I would haue willingly abſtained, did he not oblige me to it. For I appeale to the Proteſtant Reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not fit, that when he pretends by fictitious Titles to gain credit to his cauſe, and to his arguments with the vulgar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I should open their eyes, to ſee that he is not, what he ſayes he is The Prieſts and Leuits, ſent by the Iews to the great Baptiſt, to know what he was 10.1. made him two very different queſtions, <hi>VVhat are you; VVhat do yo ſay of yourſelf;</hi> Knowing that often tyms, there is a vaſt difference betwixt <hi>vvhat a man really is,</hi> and <hi>vvhat hè ſayes he is.</hi> And this neuer appeared more
<pb facs="tcp:41955:10"/>apparently, than in the great difference that is, betwixt what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sall is,</hi> and what he ſayes <hi>he is.</hi> And it is very important for the truth of the cauſe which I defend, that the Reader take notice of this difference: for wyſe men, dot not ſo much conſider the quality of the perſon that ſpeakes, as what he ſpeakes; and value not an argument, for his ſake who propoſes it, but for its own merit: But Men of vulgar capacity, who do not vnderſtand the ſtrength or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an argument; value it not for what it is in itſelf; but for the learning and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Perſon, that propoſes it whence it is, that men of common vnderſtanding, who know not the weakneſs of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, will, not withſtanding, belieue them to be very pregnant, becauſe they are of a man of that vogue and credit, which he moſt vniuſtly vſurpes, of a <hi>great Diuine,</hi> a <hi>Venerable Rector,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſor of Diuinity:</hi> ſo that the moſt dangerous we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apon wherewith he attacks vs, is his credit and Authority, which belongs not to him. If he were content to fight vs with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; wee would be content with a bare anſwer, for vpon the learned men they would neuer make any impreſſion; nor vpon the vnlearned, who to value an
<pb facs="tcp:41955:10"/>argument, only looks on the Proponent: but when he comes to fight vs, in the shape of a very learned Diuine, and a great Maſter in Sciences; wee muſt vnmask his ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and vanity, leaſt his arguments, which in themſelues haue no force, aſſiſted with that vſurped credit and authority, may work on the Spirits of ignorant People.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this Treatiſe may ſeeme larger, than might be thought neceſſary for an anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls diſcourſe: I confeſs it is; and were I to conſider only what his diſcourſe deſerues, it required no anſwer; for it contains nothing but what has been ſaid twenty tymes and anſwered ſo many more: though, this being the firſt Eſſay of this great Diuine in fauor of Proteſtancy, its ſtrang if he were ſo learned as he would haue vs belieue him to be, but that it should be an exquiſit peece: yet I haue thought fit to anſwer it, and do intend not only an anſwer to him, which could haue been don in fewer lynes, but an exact diſcuſſion of the Points he toucheth, and particularly of that prime and great Controuerſy of which depends the reſolution of all others, The infallibility of a liuing Iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, which is the Church. Therefore, for a full ſatisfaction of thoſe that deſire
<pb facs="tcp:41955:11"/>to know and embrace truth I diuide this Treatiſe into two Parts; in the firſt I will proue the Neceſſity of a liuing infallible Iudge of Controuerſies, and proue it to be the Roman Catholik Church. In the ſecond I will examin thoſe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Errors, which he faſtens on our Church; and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor to leaue nothing vnanſwered that he obiects againſt vs, though I may prepone or poſtpone his arguments as the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of my diſcourſe requires. If my labor Proue to your ſpiritual aduantage, I am ſufficiently rewarded; if not, I shall not want a reward from him that erowns good deſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fare well.</p>

But it is not arbitrary to Man, to adore God with what manner of Worship his fancy ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts vnto him; or his priuat ſpirit inclins him vnto. God, as he requires a Worship at our hands, ſo he has himſelf reuealed, what manner of Worship he requires. Perdiſcamus (ſayes S. Chryſoſt. hom. 51. in Mat.) <hi>Chriſtum ex ſua voluntate honorare; nam qui honoratur, eo maxime honore laetatur, quem ipſe vult, non quem nos optamus.</hi> What ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Rites, and Ceremonies, God would be adored with in the old law, he declared it to his People by Moyſes Leuit. from the firſt, to the 7. chap. and declared that he would not be otherwiſe worshipped Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. 10. In the law of Grace, his ſon Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, abolished that Ceremonial law; and reuealed to Mankind a new manner of diuine worship, a new Sacrifice, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rites and Ceremonies; by which he will be worshipped, and by no other: in ſo much that by S. Paul Gal. 1.9. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that if an Angel from heauen should recommend vnto vs an other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diuine worship, wee should not heed him.</p>
               <p>This worship of God, reuealed by him to Man, is true Religion; worship him euer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41955:13"/>ſo much, if you do not adore him, as he has reuealed he would be worshipped, you haue not true Religion. That there is a true Religion extant, it's doubtleſs, both for that wee pretend each of vs, his own Religion to be the true one; and that God has laid a command vpon vs, and wee are obliged to worship him in ſpirit and Truth (this is Religion) which command and obligation ſuppoſes the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. That among all thoſe Religions, wherwith the world abounds, there is but one true Religion, (whateuer, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be) its alſo manifeſt; for true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is that manner of diuine worship, which God has reuealed; but God has not reuealed thoſe ſeueral manners of diuine worship, which do oppoſe and contradict one another: if it be he that reuealed wee should worship him by denying the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> as the Iewdoes; certainly it muſt not be he that reuealed wee muſt worship him by belieuing in the Meſſias as the Chriſtians do: conſequently both thoſe Religions of Iudaiſm and Chriſtianity muſt not be true Religions. If it be he that commanded, wee should worship him by belieuing the real Preſence of Chriſt his Body in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt;</hi> certainly its not he that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41955:14"/>wee should worship him by denying the real preſence, for that would be to contradict himſelf: therefore of all thoſe Religions, which clash one with an other, only one muſt be the true Religion.</p>
               <p>This is further proued: No Religion, wherin God is duely worshipped, and a man may be ſaued; can iuſtly be called, an <hi>accurſed, heretical,</hi> and <hi>damnable</hi> Religion; this Poſition is euident: (conſequently it appears how vniuſtly Proteſtants call the Catholik Religion, <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious;</hi> it being by their own acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment as wee will proue againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, a religion wherin wee may be ſaued and conſequently wherin God is duely worshipped) But S. Paul in expreſs tearms, does anathematiſe, accurſe and condemn all and each Religion, (euen thoſe that are Chriſtian Religions) beſids that one which he and his fellow Apoſtles did teach; <hi>if vvee</hi> (Gal. 1.9.) <hi>or an Angel from Heauen, should Euangelize vnto you, othervvyſe than as vvee haue don, let him be accurſed:</hi> purſuant to which doctrin, Hymenaeus, Philetus and others, declining ſom what the doctrin of the Apoſtles, in the Article of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body,</hi> not abſolutly denying it, but ſaying it was already paſt 1. Tim. 1.20.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41955:14"/>and 2. Tim. 2.18. they ſtill remayned within the verge of Chriſtianity, but becauſe by their error in that Article only, they were of a different Religion from that of S. Paul, he delivers them to Satan, calls them <hi>cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Cankers</hi> and <hi>ſubuertors of the Faith;</hi> which would haue been a manifeſt iniuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in him, if they ſtiil remayned in a true Religion, where God was duely worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: it follows therfore that no other, euen Chriſtian Religion, is a true Religion, but that one which S. Paul profeſſed and from which they departed.</p>
               <p>And if any Chriſtian Religion, with a good Moral lyfe were ſufficient for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Prelats and Paſtors of the Church in all ages are to be laught at, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual care of keeping their flock in vnity of Faith and doctrin, wheras any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ſufficient with a good Moral ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, the General Councils were moſt rash and impious in condemming Arrius Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius, and other heretiks, wheras they ſtill remained Chriſtians, and the lyues of many of them were moſt iuſt and vpright as S. Auguſtin teſtifies of the Pelagians. Let the Libertins then, of our age be vndecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, who to ſecure their intereſt and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition are ready to embrace any Religion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41955:15"/>that is the moſt preualent in the ſtate; for all (though Chriſtians) Religions but that one which S. Paul profeſſed; all but that, whoſe vnity the Prelats and Concils did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauor to preſerue, are accurſed, hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and impious.</p>
               <p>Now ſince of all Religions, that only is the true, which God has revealed vnto vs; and that no other worship will pleaſe him; doubtleſs he has afforded vs the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſufficient means, to know what Religion it is, and to diſtinguish it from other pretended Religions which he has not reuealed. Without Faith and Religion it is impoſſible to be ſaued; God therfore who deſires our ſaluation, and commands vs vnder pain of damnation to haue true Faith, muſt haue prouided vs of the means neceſſary to attain to true Faith. Let vs examin what Faith is: It's an Aſſent giuen to an object, for the teſtimony of him that propoſes it: it is therefore grounded on the Authority of the Proponent; and can haue no more aſſurance of the Truth, than the teſtimony on which it is grounded as for example <hi>Human Faith,</hi> wherwith I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue what a Man of credit and knowen honeſty tells me, can haue no more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, than the credit and honeſty of that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41955:15"/>Man has: and wheras Men, let them be few or many in Number, vſing only natural means, may deceiue or be deceiued; either in the teſtimony they giue, or in the grounds of their Aſſertion; be it the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their ſenſes, (which are ſubiect to fallacy) or the euidence of their Natural reaſon (for ſom times, reaſons that ſeeme to vs euident, are but ſophiſtries) it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that human Faith, which relyes only, on the teſtimony of men, is fallible: for though it may happen, that <hi>de facto</hi> it is true, and that there may be moral certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its being true; yet abſolutly it might be otherwyſe, and ſo the Faith grounded vpon it is ſtill fallible.</p>
               <p>But diuine Faith; That Aſſent which Gods requires of vs to reuealed Truths, muſt be an infallible <hi>Faith,</hi> which not only is true, but cannot be otherwiſe than true; it muſt be a firm Aſſent in the higheſt degree of certainty, excluding all doubts and feare of being miſtaken: and wheras Faith has no other aſſurance of the Truth, than the Authority of the Proponent, it follows that diuine Faith muſt rely vpon a moſt infallible vndoubted Authority, which can not deceiue or be deceiued. Hence it follows that no euidence of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41955:16"/>(for our ſenſations are deceitfull) can be a ſufficient ground for diuine Faith, nor no natural reaſon; for if it be proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or only morally euident; it may be falſe, or falſified; if abſolutly euident; it can be no ground of <hi>Faith,</hi> becauſe Faith being <hi>an argument of things not appearing,</hi> as S. Paul ſaies, it ſurpaſſes natural reaſon; and becauſe that if it be euident, it forces the vnderſtanding to an Aſſent, and ſo leaues no place for the merit of <hi>Faith</hi> which conſiſts in belieuing what the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may deny, becauſe of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie it finds in aſſenting to an obſcure obiect; which the <hi>vvill</hi> aſſiſted with the <hi>pious inclination ouercomes,</hi> and thereby me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. No Hiſtories nor doctrin of Fathers, no teſtimony or authority of any fallible Church or congregation, is ſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diuine <hi>Faith</hi> being infallibly certain muſt be grounded vpon an infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Laſtly it follows, that only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible written word of God, or the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an infallible Church, muſt be it, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch propoſes vnto vs the reuealed Truths, and on which wee muſt bottom our Faith.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall ſaies as to this particular: he was once of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Scripture alone was not the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41955:16"/>means appointed by God for propoſing vnto vs the reuealed Truths, their ſence not being obuious euen to learned men, and conſequently not the means ſuitable to vulgar capacityes, who being, as well as the learned, obliged to belieue, the means for attaining to the knowledge of Religion muſt be ſuitable to their capacity, as well as to that of the learned; and Scripture through the difficulty of it ſurpaſſes both: therefore, it became the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God, to appoint a viſible Iudge, aſſiſted with his infallible ſpirit, that in caſe of doubt should determin our controuerſies, and declare vnto vs what we ought to belieue. <hi>But,</hi> ſaies he, pag. 27. <hi>the</hi> Archbishop of Cashell obiecting, <hi>that vve ought to be very vvary in cenſuring the VViſdom of God, if this or that vvas not don in the gouernment of the vvorld, vvhich ſeemeth to vs good to be don; the Modeſty of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent added ſuch vveight to this aduertiſment that it touched me to the quick, and reflecting on this point in my ſolitudes, I ſavv ſaies he, vvee might as vvell ſay that it belongeth to the goodneſs of God, not to permit that his holy lavves should be tranſgreſſed by vile crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; nor that the Paſtors of ſouls, eſpecially the Pope, should ſcandalize their flock and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41955:17"/>as vvee do not iudge it a failure in his goodneſs to permit ſins; ſo vvee ought not vvauer in our opinion of his goodneſs and VViſdom, if he has not appointed a viſible Iudge for our direction, hauing giuen us the holy Scriptures, vvhich a bound vvith all light and heauenly doctrin, to ſuch as are not vvillfully obſtinat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, heere are three different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Chriſt's preſence in the Sacrament, Catholik, Lutheran, and Proteſtant: of the three quite oppoſit one to the other, God has reuealed but one as I for merly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed; and obliges me vnder pain of damnation to belieue that ſence and no other; I ſay <hi>under pain of damnation,</hi> for ſaid he, <hi>if you vvill not eate the flesh of the ſon of Man and drink his bloud, you shall not haue lyfe in you.</hi> Io. 6. muſt I not expect of Gods goodneſs that he will afford vnto me what is abſolutly need full to acquit this obligation? he abſolutly requires of me to belieue that ſence, and no other of thoſe three which he reuealed: muſt I not then expect of his goodneſs ſome means to aſcertain me which of thoſe three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion is that which he reuealed? would it be conſiſtent with his goodneſs to oblige me vnder pain of damnation to flye to the Moon, and afford me no wings
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41955:17"/>(which wee ſuppoſe are indiſpenſably need full) for to acquit that obligation? The Aſſent which he requires at my hands, is not a probable and dubious one; but an Aſſent which renders me aſſured, in the higheſt degree of certainty, of the Truth I profeſs; ſuch and no other is diuine Faith: ſuch an Aſſent is impoſſible if there be not an infallible Authority on which it is grounded; which you Proteſtants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, for its therefore you reiect Tradition, and will admit no other Teſt of Faith but the written word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Faith muſt be grounded vpon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authority, you ſay, and Tradition is fallible and nothing infallible but Gods written word. if Scripture were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtles, could not you ſay wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout any iniury to God, that it became his wiſdom to afford you ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Authority, wheras without ſuch an authority it's impoſſible to haue the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Faith which he requires? and was it not therfore that he gaue to his Apoſtles who preached to the primitiue Chriſtians, the credit of infallible Oracles, becauſe then there was no Scripture written nor any other Authority wherupon to bottom their Faith, but the teſtimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41955:18"/>Since therfore wee do manifeſtly proue that Scripture alone is not ſufficient to determin Controuerſies, and inſtruct vs what wee are bound to belieue, let not your inſtructors <hi>Modeſty</hi> take it ill that wee ſay it becomes the goodneſs of God to appoint a liuing infallible Iudge on who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe teſtimony and authority wee may rely and ground our Faith. Vvee ſay with St Auguſtin l. de vtil. cred. ad Honorat. <hi>Si Prouidentia Dei non praeſidet rebus humanis, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil eſt de religione ſatagendum. Si autem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidet non eſt deſperandum ab eodem ipſo Deo, authoritatem aliquam conſtitutam eſſe qua ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut gradu certo attolamur ad Deum. If Gods Prouidence gouerns not the vvorld, vvee need not be ſollicitous of Religion; but if Prouidence rules all, it cannot be doubted but that God has appointed an authority, by vvhich, as by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain aſſured vvay vvee may be lead to God.</hi> Vvee muſt therefore grant ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (which is not Scripture as wee will proue) or deny Prouidence.</p>
               <p>Your inſtance is very weake, and vn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo great a diuine as you profeſs to be; Gods goodneſs cannot be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for permitting ſins and the ſcandals of Popes; nay it's becoming his goodneſs to permit them; for hauing created Man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41955:18"/>with perfect liberty for to work well or ill, it becomes his goodneſs to giue him all that is needfull for the exercyſe of that liberty; and Man could not exercyſe it (if wee did not pretend to ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary miraculous Prouidence for which wee haue no ground in Scripture nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to which his goodneſs cannot oblige him) if he did not permit him to ſin: and to queſtion God why his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth permit ſin, is to ask why he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man with perfect liberty? which if you do, I anſwer; becauſe he gaue him liberty that he might vſe it well; and if he vſes it ill; its his own fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVee ought not,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to vvauer in our opinion of Gods goodneſs for not appointing a Liuing infallible Iudge, vvheras he has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us the Scriptures vvhich abound vvith all heauenly light to them, that are not vvill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſtinat:</hi> and this you proue 2. Tim. 3.16. <hi>Holy Scriptures are able to make us vvyſe vnto ſaluation, that the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, throughly furnished unto all good vvorks.</hi> But I infer to the contrary: wheras the Scriptures, though replenished they be with heauenly light, are not ſufficient for to declare vnto vs what wee ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue; wee might wauer in our opinion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41955:19"/>of Gods goodneſs, if he did not appoint an infallible liuing Iudge for to inſtruct vs: and that the Scriptures are not ſufficient for the inſtruction of them <hi>that are not vvillfully blind.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall himſelf proues it; for pag. 17. he tells vs that doubting of the Tenets of our Religion, his wit not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with an <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> lyke <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his ſcholler, demanded Reaſon for what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued: he betooke himſelf to the frequent reading of Scripture: but, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, if you be not content with an <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> you are as vnfit for Chriſt's ſchoole, as for that of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> and if your wit demands reaſon for what you belieue, Scripture is no place to ſeeke for it, which affords nothing but a bare <hi>ipſe dixit.</hi> After reading the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, he was ſo far from being ſufficiently inſtructed, that he confeſſes they made him doubt: whence it appears, that Scripture alone is not ſufficient euen to thoſe that are not <hi>vvillfully blind,</hi> he was no ſuch, for he did read with a real deſire of being inſtructed.</p>
               <p>The text of S. Paul ſayes <hi>that Scripture is able to make us vvyſe to ſalvation;</hi> but does noy ſay, that <hi>Scripture alone</hi> is able: if you will haue text to be for your purpoſe, you muſt follow the example of Luther, who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41955:19"/>to proue his error of iuſtification by <hi>Faith only,</hi> corrupted the text of S. Paul Rom. 2.8. <hi>vvee account a man to be iuſtified by Faith, vvithout the vvorks of the lavv:</hi> and foiſted in the word <hi>Faith alone.</hi> 2. S. Paul in that text ſpeaks only of the Scripture wherin Timothie was verſed, and which he had peruſed from his Youth, which was only the Old Teſtament: ſo that if the text proues the ſufficiency of the Scripture for our inſtruction, it proues the ſufficiency of the Old Teſtament only. 3. S. Paul in that vers ch. v. 14. ſayes to Timothie, <hi>thou continue in thoſe things thou haſt learned, and are committed to thee knovving from vvhom thou haſt learned them.</hi> Whence its apparent that he remitted Timothie for inſtruction, to the Scripture and alſo to the doctrin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to him by a liuing Oracle, which was the Apoſtle himſelf. Laſtly the whole Canon of Scripture was not compleated when S. Paul writ that text, nor in many years after; and you can not pretend that euer wee had the ſufficient means for our inſtruction in any part, but in the whole and entyre Canon; therefore you cannot pretend that that text doth proue the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Scripture.</p>

               <p>IF Scripture alone, were the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for to declare vnto vs what wee ought to belieue; is it not ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, that Chriſt should not himſelf haue left vs a Written word to walk by, when he laid vpon vs the obligation of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing true Religion; or that he should not, at leaſt, haue laid a Command vpon his Apoſtles of deliuering vs a written word? reade the whole Canon, and you shall find no ſuch command: but he left Apoſtles and Paſtors, and a command vpon them, to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>preach</hi> vnto vs; and vpon vs of belieuing and obeying them; which argues that the means which he deſigned for our inſtruction in Religion, was not a written word, but a liuing Church. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity is laid upon me, yea vvo is vnto me if I preach not the Ghoſpel.</hi> 1. Cor. 9.16. He feared no <hi>vvo</hi> for not <hi>vvriting,</hi> but for not <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> the Ghoſpel; becauſe he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the flock of the means which God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41955:20"/>appointed for their inſtruction. And the Channel by which Faith is conueyed vnto vs being our <hi>Eares, fides ex auditu,</hi> and not our <hi>Eyes,</hi> it ſeems apparent, that the means which he appointed is a liuing Oracle who ſpeaks, and not a volum which wee reade.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles did by ſpecial command of Chriſt write the Ghoſpel: this is manifeſt, that ſince the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of the Church, Chriſtians did doubt, which was the true Scripture written by the Apoſtles and which not: there is not one part of all Scripture but was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned and denied by ſome Chriſtians to be Canonical: Cerdon the Valentinians, and Manichaeans denyed the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be Scripture. Epiph. Haer. 41. The Ebionits reiected the four great Prophets, the Books of Salamon and Pſalms of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. Epiph. Haer. 30. Marcionits reiected all the Ghoſpels except that of S. Luke. idem Haer. 4.2. and Irer. l. 1. c. 6. the Ebionits did own only that of S. Mathew. They alſo reiected the Epiſtles of S. Paul Epiph. Haer. 30. And the Diſciples of Cerdon would not belieue the Acts of the Apoſtles Tert. de Praeſcrip. c. 51. The Lutherans this day blot out of the Canon the Epiſtle of S. Paul to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41955:21"/>the Hebrews, as alſo that of Iude, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of S. Peter and ſecond and Third of S. Iohn, all which the Caluiniſts belieue. The Church of England will not admit the Books of Machabees, Eſther Iudith and others, which the Chatolik Church admits: nor did the Ancient Fathers of the Church proue againſt the Marcioniſts and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks thoſe Books to be Scripture by the Scripture itſelf, but by the Church as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin l. cont. Epiſc. Man. c. 5. <hi>Euangelio non crederem, niſi me Eccleſiae commoueret Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas: I vvould not belieue the Ghoſpel to be the Ghoſpel, if the authoriiy of the Church did not moue me to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I argue thus: you ſay true Religion is knowen by Scripture alone; that's to ſay, wee haue no aſſurance of a Truths being a reuealed Truth but by Scripture alone. Therfore wee can haue no more aſſurance of a Truths being a reuealed Truth, than wee haue of the Scriptur's (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that Truth) being true Scripture: if therefore you be not innfallibly aſcertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that this is true Scripture, you cannot be infallibly aſcertained that the Truths which it contains are reuealed Truths: But Scripture alone giues no aſſurance that it is true Scripture; that it is not corrupted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41955:21"/>either by the malice or ignorance of the tranſlators, or inaduertency of the Printer; for there is not a text in all Scripture that mentions it: therfore the Scripture alone cannot aſcertain vs of the Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And it cannot be imagined but that, ſince the true ſence of Scripture is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, God has prouided vs of ſome means to know which is the true ſence; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſince that wee are obliged to belieue with diuine Faith, that this Booke is Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; it cannot be doubted I ſay, but that God has afforded ſome means for to aſcertain vs which is true Scripture, and to confound thoſe that deny the Scripture to be Scripture. But Scripture it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone can neuer aſſure vs of its being Scripture.</p>
               <p>For to ſay that Scripture doth manifeſt itſelf to be Gods word by certain <hi>Criteria,</hi> or ſigns found in Scripture itſelf, as a <hi>diuine beam of light, a Maieſty of ſtyle,</hi> an <hi>energy of vvords,</hi> wherby it does manifeſt it ſelf to the humble and well intentioned harts to be Gods word; theſe are but fond imaginations: for all the Ancient Fathers of the firſt 402. years of the Church, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs were as humble, and as well inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as wee, and all that tyme the Epiſtle
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41955:22"/>of S. Paul to the Hebrews, Iude and S. Peeters ſecond Epiſtle, and ſecond and Third of S. Iohn were not belieued, as an article of Faith to be Scripture; nay were abſolutly denyed to be ſuch, by Tert. Cypr. Lactan. and others; and yet they had the ſame Majeſty of ſtyle, and energy of words, as now they haue: and whateuer you may iudge of vs Catholiks, Luther, you will ſay, was humble and well intentioned, and could ſee no ſuch <hi>Criteria</hi> or ſigns in thoſe Epiſtles, which Caluin belieues to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and 'tis but a fond imagination to conceit any ſuch luſtre or Majeſty in thoſe Books, which you belieue, more than in the Books of Tobias, Eſther and others which you deny. Conſider, I pray, if a Pagan deſirous of his ſaluation, were placed in a vaſt Library, could he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Scripture from other Books, and know it to be the word of God, only by reading it: and if you did euer reade, of any Kingdom couerted to Chriſtianity by reading the Bible only, without Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal men to expound the Chriſtian Doctrin, and by that you may gneſs, which were the means appointed by God for our inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Scripture alone, or a liuing Church.</p>
               <p>And allowed wee be aſſured this Book
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41955:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>and an other is the word of God: of the Scripture wee may ſay, what S. Paul ſaid of the Lords ſupper: This if worthily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is life and ſaluation; if vnworthily is damation: if Scripture be vnderſtood in the true ſence intended by the Holy Ghoſt, it leads to true Religion, if vnderſtood in the wrong ſence, it leads to perdition, as S. Peter ſayes, 2. cpiſt. 3.16. ſpeaking of the Epiſtles of S. Paul, <hi>the vnlearned and vnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble depraue them, as the reſt of the Scripture, to their perdition; by misunderſtanding them.</hi> Grant this volum to be the word of God: the words of it may be, and are interpreted in diuerſe and quite oppoſit ſences; as that command of Chriſt, <hi>he that vvill not eat the flesh of the ſon of Man, and drink his bloud, shall not haue lyfe in him;</hi> it is interpreted in three oppoſit ſences by Lutherans, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks, and Proteſtants; and it is euident that Chriſt intended only one of the three ſences: wee are bound vnder pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to eat his flesh, and drink his blood, in that ſence, which he intended, and no other will ſuffice: the Scripture alone does not aſſure vs, which of thoſe three ſences, is that which Chriſt intended: for wee haue all the Scripture, wee read it, wee ſtudy, wee pray, and wee cannot agree
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41955:23"/>in the ſence of thoſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt be ſomwhat elſe beſeids Scripture, for to aſſure vs of the true ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of it; or God has left vs with an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of belieuing and not afforded vs the ſufficient means for to aſcertain vs, what he will haue vs to belieue.</p>
               <p>To ſay that God giues an inward light, and teſtimony of the ſpirit to the humble and well diſpoſed harts, which aſſures them the ſence which they hold of the Scripture is the true ſence, is a groundleſs fancy, exploded euen by the modern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; wheras thoſe illuminated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot be aſſured if that inward light be an illumination from God, or an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Satan often transfigured into an Angel of light: our Controuerſiſts haue fully refuted this foolish fancy; I only add that if the means appointed by God to aſſure us of the true ſence of Scripture, be that inward light and teſtimony of the priuat ſpirit, God has afforded no means for to keepe vs in vnity of Faith; for there are as many different lights and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the ſpirit, as there be men almoſt, and ſo his houſe will not be a houſe of peace, but of confuſion: and if that be the true ſence of Scripture, which the inward
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41955:23"/>light and teſtimony of each mans ſpirit does ſuggeſt; thoſe lights and inward te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the ſpirit being quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorily oppoſit one to the other; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the H. G. intended quite oppoſit ſences in each text of Scripture: Nor could any man reaſonably pretend to perſuade an other to be of his religion; for ſince he has no aſſurance of the truth of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but what he has by that inward light and ſpirit, how can he in reaſon go about to perſuade me, that his light and ſpirit is true, rather than that which I haue my ſelf: ſo each man muſt be content to haue his Religion to himſelf, and ſeeke no other to be of it. S. Iohn 1. Epiſt. 4.11. bids vs not to belieue euery ſpirit; but to try it; and in that very ch. directs vs to a touch ſtone wherat to try our ſpirits, <hi>He that knovveth God heareth vs; he that is not of God heareth vs not: in this vvee knovv the ſpirit of Truth, and the ſpirit of Error.</hi> If your ſpirit, heares and obeyes the Paſtors and Prelats of the Church, your ſpirit is <hi>of Truth, in this vvee knovv the ſpirit of Truth in hearing vs, not in reading vs.</hi> If your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will not heare the Church, but prefer it ſelf before the ſpirit of the Paſtors and Prelats of the Church; your ſpirit is of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41955:24"/>error. The means therefore to diſtinguish ſpirits, to know the truth, and the true ſence of Scripture, is not Scripture it ſelf, nor your inward light but the Church, which is the approuer or reprouer of ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The Modern Proteſtants haue found out an other way for to defend the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Scripture, for to vnderſtand by it alone the true ſence of it: for, ſay they, though ſome text or texts of Scripture be obſcure, yet comparing them with other texts, they are expounded, and the true ſence found by the ſcripture alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring one text with an other; eſpecially in what concerns the fundamental points of Religion neceſſary for ſaluation, which are eaſily found, and cleerly ſet down in Scripture. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall pag. 105. of his diſcourſe ſeems to be of this opinion; ſaying, <hi>that all neceſſary knovvlegde for Faith in God, to ſerue and prayſe him, is fully contained in vvhat is cleer of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing more cleer, than that the Holy Scriptures are moſt obſcure, euen in points neceſſary for ſaluation; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity conſiſting in the hight of the Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it contains, in the difficulty of its phraſes, in the ſeemingly contradictions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41955:24"/>it contains; that the moſt learned men that euer were in the Church found it a task too great for their vnderſtandings to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it: learned Proteſtants themſelues do confeſs it, and our Controuerſiſts haue ſo euidenced it, that it were a ſuperfluous labor to proue it: that only text of ſaint Peter 2. epiſt. 3. ch. which I quoted but now, ſufficiently proues it; and that no text nor texts of ſcripture compared doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſufficiently euen the fundamental points of our Religion, two inſtances do cleerly euidence.</p>
               <p>Firſt Gods <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Perſons</hi> in all Chriſtians acknowledgment is a fundamental article of Religion: wee belieue he is <hi>One</hi> not in <hi>Perſon,</hi> but in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> wee belieue he is <hi>Three,</hi> not in <hi>Nature,</hi> but in <hi>Perſons.</hi> And what text or texts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared one with an other can you bring to shew this Miſtery? Let the diſpute be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt a Proteſtant, an Arrian, and a Pagan: ſuppoſe the Pagan confeſſes and agrees with both, that the ſcripture is the word of God; but will not admit that either the Proteſtant or Arrian is infallible in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it: how will the Proteſtant proue againſt the Pagan, that God is <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> and Three in Perſons? He will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41955:25"/>alleadge out of ſaint Iohn 1. ep. 5. <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſon, and the ſpirit, and theſe Three are One<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the word <hi>One</hi> ſignifies <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the word <hi>Three Trinity</hi> in <hi>Perſons:</hi> But ſayes the Pagan, that is againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the principles of Philoſophy, that <hi>Three</hi> diſtinct <hi>Perſons</hi> should haue but <hi>One Nature;</hi> and though I do belieue the word of God to be infallibly true euen in what ſurpaſſes my reaſon, yet I will not belieue againſt my reaſon but what the word of God does aſſuredly ſay; and that text which you alleadge does only ſay they are <hi>One,</hi> but does not expreſs, if that <hi>Vnity</hi> be in <hi>Nature</hi> or in <hi>Perſon,</hi> nor doeth the text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that the <hi>Trinity</hi> is in <hi>Perſons</hi> and not in <hi>Nature:</hi> nay the Arrian, who is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as well as you, ſaieth, that text ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no ſuch <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Perſons:</hi> and in your own confeſſion, Chriſt is <hi>One ſuppoſitum</hi> or <hi>Hypoſtaſis:</hi> his <hi>Vnity</hi> is not in <hi>Nature,</hi> (for he has <hi>Tvvo Natures,</hi> one <hi>Human,</hi> and the other <hi>Diuine</hi>) but in <hi>Perſon;</hi> why may not wee alſo ſay, that the father, ſon, and ſpirit, are <hi>One,</hi> and that their vnity is not in <hi>Nature</hi> but in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> whither will the Proteſtant go now, to proue againſt the Pagan this great, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental article? He will quote out of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41955:25"/>ſaint Iohn an other text for to expound the former; <hi>My father, and I are one,</hi> Io.10.20. where it is expreſſed that the Father and ſon who are <hi>tvvo</hi> different <hi>Perſons,</hi> are but <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Nature:</hi> But, replieth the Pagan, neither does that text ſay more, but that they are <hi>One,</hi> and does not expreſs, either that they are <hi>tvvo</hi> diſtinct <hi>Perſons,</hi> or <hi>one Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſayes the Pagan, bring you as many texts as you pleaſe, you will neuer bring any, which expreſly declares the <hi>Vnity</hi> to be in <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Perſons;</hi> and I muſt not renounce reaſon ſo far, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue a Miſtery, which no human reaſon can vnſterſtand; particularly, when you require of me, to belieue only what the word of God expreſſy declares; and the word of God, which you alleadge does not expreſly declare that Miſtery, nor doeth the word of God oblige me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue your interpretation of thoſe texts: I heare the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who are Chriſtians as well as you, and they, with their Abettors, (who are not fewer in number nor inferiour in learning to you) ſay, thoſe texts which you alleadge do not at all import any <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Perſons:</hi> for the <hi>Sabellians</hi> ſay, the word
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41955:26"/>
                  <hi>One</hi> in thoſe texts ſignifies <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Perſon</hi> as well as in <hi>Nature;</hi> and the word <hi>Three</hi> ſignifies, not Three diſtinct Perſons, but one and the ſame Perſon, called by three different names, for three ſeueral Offices, which he does exerciſe: <hi>Father</hi> becauſe he is the Author of all things; <hi>Son</hi> becauſe he was born to redeem vs; and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe he ſanctifies vs: euen as, ſay they, theſe three ſeueral names, <hi>Immenſe, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> ſignify <hi>One</hi> and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me God, who includes the perfections ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified by thoſe names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arrius</hi> and his partizans vnderſtand tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe texts in a far different ſence from you Proteſtant: the word <hi>Three</hi> ſaies <hi>Arrius</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies three different <hi>Natures,</hi> which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> proues with a text, far more pertinent in appearence, than that which you Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants alleadge to proue the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> S. Io. 14.28. <hi>My father is greater than I;</hi> which text, deliuered without any reſtriction, ſaies Arrius, proues the ſon to be of a different and inferior Nature to the Father. The word <hi>One</hi> ſaies he, does not ſignify the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Three Perſons</hi> in <hi>Nature;</hi> but their <hi>Vnity</hi> by perfect conformity of <hi>VVill</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> which expoſition he proues by S. Io. 17.11. where Chriſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41955:26"/>praying for his Elect, asketh his Father, <hi>they may be one, as vvee are One:</hi> but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Elect cannot be <hi>One</hi> in Nature, nor did he ask any ſuch <hi>Vnity</hi> for them; but that they should be <hi>One</hi> by perfect Charity and conformity of <hi>vvill</hi> therefore the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are not otherwiſe <hi>One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Pagan to the Proteſtants, and adds; I belieue the Scripture to be the word of God, becauſe he has reuealed it vnto me; I am reſolued to be a Chriſtian; but I know not which party to embrace, the Proteſtant; or the Arrian; you will haue me belieue Gods <hi>Vnity</hi> in Nature and <hi>Trinity</hi> in Perſons; and though that Miſtery ſurpaſſes human reaſon, I am content to ſubmit vnto it, if I did find it expreſly in Scripture; but thoſe texts either ſinglely or all together do not expresly declare it; as I iudge and as the Arrians and Sabellians who are Chriſtians, as well as you, iudge; and on the other ſide you do not require of me to belieue, but what is expresly contained in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what shall I do in this caſe? You ſay it is expresly contained in thoſe texts; but am I bound to belieue it is contained in them, becauſe you think it is? the Scripture does not tell me that I am bound to belieue what you think,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41955:27"/>rather than what the Arrians think is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it: if I ſyde with the Arrians, you ſay I am damned: if I ſyde with you the Arrians ſay I am damned; and why to ſyde with one, rather than the other, I know not; for you are of equal authority, as to me; both learned, pious, wiſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and well verſed in Scripture. You tell me the Arrians are condemned by General Councils; Arrians and Sabellians alſo, tell me you are condemned by ſeueral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, in the points you hold in oppoſition to the Catholicks; you ſay the Councils and Ancient Fathers, who condemned you did err, and were miſtaken in the ſence of Scripture: the Arrians and Sabellians alſo, ſay the Councils which condemned them, did err: you ſay the Miſtery of the Trinity is vnanimously belieued by Proteſtants and Roman Catholiks: but I ask, what credit hath the Roman and Proteſtant Church? ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue you the credit of infallible Oracles, by which God ſpeakes, or haue you only the credit of wiſe, learned pious men? if the firſt; that indeed is ſomewhat, and ends all Controuerſy: if only the ſecond, the Arrians, Sabellians, Heathen and Pagan Philoſophers, are as numerous as you, as learned, wiſe, and, as to moral honeſty, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41955:27"/>good as you, and they all deny that Myſtery.</p>
               <p>Can any man of reaſon, ſay, this Pagan in this occaſion, is obliged to ſide with the Proteſtants, rather than with the Arrians? they both haue Scripture, they are all Chriſtians, they reade and ſtudy it, they are both fallible in the interpretation of it; and that either of both is effectually miſtaken in this caſe, its manifeſt: and which of them it is, this Man has no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable means to be aſſured of. Now if God has appointed a liuing infallible Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, to interpret, and deliuer the true ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Scripture; this Pagan could not but be obliged to acquieſce to his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence its is manifeſt that Scripture alone is not ſufficient for to aſcertain vs of the true ſence of Scripture, euen in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points.</p>
               <p>An other inſtance to proue this truth: there is a point of Faith, which we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to belieue vnder pain of damnation, which is not expreſſed in any text or texts compared of Scripture alone, whitout an infallible interpreter. I do not meane the Neceſſity of Infants Baptiſm, nor the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Heretiks Baptiſm, belieued by both Churches, and for which, ſaies S. Auguſtin l. 1. cont. creſc. c. 32. <hi>there can be no example
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41955:28"/>brought out holy of Scripture.</hi> I proue it thus: Wee Catholiks and you Proteſtants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, if Purgatory be a fundamental point of Religion or not? If it be; its a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble error, to ſay it is not; both for that errors againſt fundamental points are damnable, as you confeſs, and for that to deny for fundamental, that which is a fundamental Truth reuealed by God, is to diminish of the word of God; by which you deſerue to be blotted out of the Book of life; Apoc. 22. If it be not a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental point; it is a damnable error to ſay it is; for that would be to add to the word of God; which alſo deſerues to be blotted out of the Book of life: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in this our conteſt, wee are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably obliged to belieue, either that it is, or that it is not: nor can wee ſuſpend our Iudgment, but muſt reſolue abſolutly on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no text or texts of Scripture do declare, if it be, or be not a fundamental article of Faith, if not expounded by ſome infallible interpreter: therefore Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re alone is not ſufficient, for to aſſure vs what wee are obliged to belieue.</p>

               <p>LOoke back to the Infancy of the Church, for the firſt eight or tenn years; there was not a word of the New Teſtament written; and the laſt part, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that part was, wherin the Doctors do not agree) was not written in 40. years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt his Aſcenſion: part of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, after it was written did perish; for example an Epiſtle of S. Paul to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians mentioned 1. Cor. 5.9. by which wee vnderſtand that he writ three epiſtles to them, whereof two only are extant: alſo part of the old Teſtament was loſt, as appears Chron. 9.12. and 29. Nay this very Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ure that now is extant, and owned by vs all to be Canonical, for the firſt 402. was not (a good part of it) ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be ſuch; for the Fathers of the Church diſputed, and many denyed S. Pauls epiſtle to the Hebr. Iudes epiſt. ſecond of ſaint Peter, ſecond and Third of ſaint Iohn to be Canonical; conſequently they could
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41955:29"/>not be the Teſt of Faith; becauſe they were not belieued to be Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all this tyme, as there was an obligation vpon Chriſtians to belieue, ſo they had the ſufficient means, for to know what they were obliged to belieue; which was not Scripture, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe either it was not written, or if written, it was not all, (as now it is) belieued to be Scripture: therefore God muſt haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome other means beſids Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, for to inſtruct vs in Religion.</p>
               <p>And if you inſiſt, that the Scripture, as now it is extant, is the needfull and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means for our inſtruction, I infer; therefore wee had not the needfull and ſufficient means, vntill all this Scripture now extant was written; conſequently the Church, was for many years without the ſufficient means for inſtruction: I infer again; therefore vntill the laſt text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was written, wee had not the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means; and wheras you are bound to proue by a cleer text, that Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the ſufficient means, it muſt be with the laſt text of all ſcripture you muſt proue it; for then, and no ſooner, was the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the ſufficient means, when the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Canon was completed, and the laſt text was written; and this is impoſſible to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41955:29"/>proued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo it follows, that you muſt not pretend to proue the ſufficiency of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by any text of the new or old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, written before the laſt text; wheras the whole Canon was not completed, when thoſe texts were written; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they could not proue the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of ſcripture which in your ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledgment did not begin to be the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means, vntill the Canon was finisht. Moreouer if the ſcripture, as now it is extant, be the needfull and ſufficient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; then the Lutherans, whom you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to your Communion, and embrace as Brethren, haue not the ſufficient means for diuine Faith, (and conſequently nor Faith itſelf) wheras they deny many parts of Scripture to be Canonical, which you belieue.</p>
               <p>But what moſt cleerly proues that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as now it is extant, is not the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and needfull means, is this diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; firſt its not the <hi>needfull</hi> means, for if a very conſiderable part of this Scripture did perish, wee would ſtill haue the ſufficient means, in what would remain of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to inſtruct vs in what wee are bound to belieue; for what wee are bound to belieue vnder pain of damnation, are only the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41955:30"/>eſſential and fundamental points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; whoeuer belieues them, though he denies other points not <hi>fundamental,</hi> and <hi>inferior</hi> Truths, in the doctrin of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, belieues what is ſufficient for his ſaluation; but there are many chapters, or at leaſt half chapters, or at leaſt many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Scripture, which do not in the leaſt mention any eſſential and fundamental point of Religion; therefore all thoſe chapters and verſes are not needfull for to know what wee are bound to belieue; and if they did all perish, wee would in what remained, haue the ſufficient means. Now that Scripture as now it is extant, is not the <hi>ſufficient</hi> means, I proue it: for if any part of Scripture be the ſufficient means, it muſt be that part, which contains the fundamental and eſſential articles of Religion; and wheras you do not know, nor could any of your Doctors euer yet (though often deſired by vs) giue a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of thoſe, which you call fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, which they be, and how are they diſtinguisht from not fundamental points; its impoſſible that you can tell which part of Scripture is that, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the the fundamental points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently you cannot tell which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41955:30"/>part of ſcripture in the <hi>ſufficient</hi> for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>That the Church was the means appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God for our inſtruction, before the ſcripture was written, the Proteſtant do not, nor cannot deny: and if they will not wauer in their Principles, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it continued ſo, vntill the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was finisht; (which was not vntill many years after Chriſt his Aſcenſion:) But, ſay they, ſcripture being written, which doubteleſs God gaue vnto vs, for no other end, than to be our guide and rule of Faith, the Church ſurceaſed from that office, and is not to be regarded further, than as she agrees with that written word: ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſcripture was receiued for Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Oracle, the Church was casheered out of thoſe glorious offices, which formerly she enioyed: becauſe (as our Aduerſaries pretend) there was no need of any other infallible Oracle, but the ſcripture, which in the iudgment of all is ſuch. If this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be good; it proues alſo, that the Apoſtles ceaſed to be our inſtructors, and infallible Oracles after the ſcripture was written; and that the Church ceaſed to be infallible in fundamental points, becauſe the ſcripture is an infallible oracle, contains
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41955:31"/>all points, and one infallible Oracle is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: yet our Aduerſaries confeſs that the Apoſtles remained ſtill infallible; and the Church in fundamental points.</p>
               <p>And, wheras all ſcripture was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at once, but ſucceſſiuly by parts; the Church was not deueſted of teaching vs, but by degrees, as the parts of ſcripture were written; which paradox, though ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, follows out of the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But what if part, or all the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did perish; which is not impoſſible, both becauſe that ſome part of it has pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht already, and that there is nor in all ſcripture, any promiſs of its perpetuity, as there is of the perpetuity of the Church: then, I hope the ſcripture would return to her ancient prerogatiue of being the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means appointed for our inſtruction: this extrauagant poſition you are bound to affirm, and you can shew no ſcripture for it, and yet you can belieue nothing but what is in ſcripture.</p>
               <p>I should think this a good diſcourſe: the Church was once our guide, and means appointed to aſcertain vs of the truths when the ſcripture that now is extant, was not written: But the ſcripture now owned for ſuch, does not ſay, the Church was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41955:31"/>deueſted of that Prerogatiue; therefore I am ſtill obliged to belieue she enioyeth it: for the obligation that once was, and it not proued to be abolished remains ſtill in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: there was an obligation of belieuing the Church to be Gods infallible Oracle; nothing appears, that taketh away that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: therefore its ſtill in force.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Neceſſity of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter beſides Scripture, for to inſtruct vs what wee are to belieue, is proued, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Chriſt did place Apoſtles, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, Doctors and Paſtors in his Church, Eph. 4.11. for this end, as the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly faies, for to keep vs in <hi>Vnity</hi> of Faith, to inſtruct vs, <hi>that vvee may be no more Children vvauering to and fro and carried avvay vvith euery vvind of doctrin.</hi> but alſo by the practice of the Catholik and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churchs, who giue ſuch vaſt reuenews to Eccleſiaſtical perſons for teaching the flock, and expounding the Myſteries of Faith; if ſcripture were ſo cleer in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points, what needed any more, but to giue each one a Bible, and imploy the Rents of the Clergy in ſome other vſe? what needed ſo many authentick Chriſtian doctrins published by both Churchs for to declare the Myſteries of Religion? what
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41955:32"/>needed ſo many Volums and Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rîes of the Fathers vpon the ſcripture, if it alone is cleer, full, and plain in what wee are bound to belieue?</p>

               <p>NO Proteſtant, at leaſt of our tymes, will deny the exiſtence of a true Church, it being an article of the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>I belieue the holy Catholik Church.</hi> The true Notion of it, wee haue from S. Paul Rom. 12.4. by a compariſon of it with a Natural Body: as this hath ſeueral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, each one wherof hath its proper function; ſo wee all, as ſo many different members, which exerciſe diverſe func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, concurr to conſtitute one Body in Chriſt. In the natural Body, there is a head, which is the ſeat of the Iudgment which gouerns; there are eyes to ſee, ears to heare, a mouth to ſpeake: hands to work and feet to walk: thus in the Church,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41955:32"/>Chriſt's myſtical Body; there muſt be a head to gouern, which is the ſuprem Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; there muſt be eyes to pry, and examin the truth; and theſe are the Doctors; there muſt be hands to deliuer the word of God, and a mouth to ſpeake; and theſe are the Preachers, Paſtors and Curats, there muſt be eares to heare and feet to walk which are the flock. Hence wee gather the true Notion of the Church of God to be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſociety of true belieuers, under one ſuprem Paſtor, where the Faith of Chriſt is taught and belieued.</p>
               <p>The Church therefore is conſtituted of two parts, the <hi>One</hi> whoſe obligation is to teach and rule the flock: the <hi>other</hi> whoſe obligation is to obey and belieue what the Church by her Paſtors and Doctors does teach and command; and wheras the Church was ſtill extant (or the article of our Creed was ſome tyme falſe) it follows, there were ſtill extant Paſtors, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who did teach the true Faith of Chriſt, and a flock that belieued it. As to the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Church to inſtruct and gouern vs, theſe texts of ſcripture euince it: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity is laid vpon me for to preach, and vvo be to me if I preach not.</hi> 1. Cor. 9.16. <hi>Attend to yourſelues and to the vvhole flock, vvherin
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41955:33"/>the H. G. has placed you Bishops to rule the Church of God.</hi> Act. 20.23. Which obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was layd an the Apoſtles and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, when Chriſt commanded them <hi>to teach all Nations, to preach the Ghoſpel vnto all creatures:</hi> which obligation S. Paul doth in ſeueral places of his Epiſtles declare, but particularly Eph. 4.11. <hi>He placed in his Church, ſom Apoſtles, and ſom Prophets, others ſom Euangeliſts, others ſom Paſtors, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> and declares to what end did Chriſt prouide his Church of them: <hi>for the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Saints into the vvork of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; that vvee may meet in the vnity of Faith, that vvee be no more children vvauering to and fro, and carried avvay vvith euery vvind of Doctrin.</hi> Whence two conſequences follow; the firſt that if you be toſſed in your mind, and doubtfull what to belieue; if <hi>tvvo Sacraments</hi> or <hi>ſeauen;</hi> if <hi>real Preſence</hi> or <hi>figuratiue;</hi> you are not to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with euery wind of Doctrin; but go the Church, which God has furnished with Doctors Apſtoles, and Paſtors for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you: the ſecond conſequence; that Chriſt Faith being but <hi>One,</hi> and wee obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to liue in the <hi>Vnity</hi> of that Faith, the Apoſtle tells vs in this text, that the means which he has appointed for to keepe vs in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41955:33"/>
                  <hi>Vnity</hi> of Faith, are the Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Doctors and Paſtors of the Church, that the Church by them may lead vs to the <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiion of one Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other part which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutes the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, is the flock, whoſe obligation is to obey and belieue what she by her Doctors and Paſtors does teach and command vs: this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation is manifeſtly proued Mat. 23.2. <hi>all, that they, vvho ſit on the chayr of Moyſes, vvill ſay vnto you, that obſerue and do.</hi> Lu. 10.16. Chriſt commands, that he who will not heare the Church, is to be eſteemed a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> and a <hi>Publican,</hi> and adds that <hi>he vvho deſpeiſeth her, deſpeiſeth him;</hi> that is to ſay he that deſpeiſeth her Doctrin, which S. Paul expounds 1. Theſ. 4.8. when after giuing them inſtructions, he ſaies. <hi>He that deſpeiſeth theſe things, deſpeiſeth not man, but God: and</hi> 2. Theſ. 3.14. <hi>he that obeyeth not our vvord, do not acompagny him, that he may be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Theſe cleer and manifeſt texts proue the obligation of the flock to belieue, and obey the Doctrin, and commands, which the Church by her Paſtors and Doctors layeth vpon them. Whence it appears that the Church is the Oracle, and Miſtreſs, which Chriſt has appointed on earth for to inſtruct and gouern vs.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41955:34"/>
               <p>This diſcourſe that the Church is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of two parts, the one whoſe obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to teach and gouern, the otherwhoſe obligation is to learn, belieue and obey, is cleerly shewen in the 1. Cor. 3. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle compares the Paſtors and Prelats to Husband men, who ſoweth the ſeed, and to Maſterbuilders that make a houſe; and compares the flock to a field that receiues the ſeed and improuments, and to an edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. But, ſaies he, <hi>He that planteh, and he that vvatereth are one,</hi> and <hi>euery man shall receiue his ovvn revvard according his ovvn vvorks; vvee are labourers together vvith God, ye are Gods Husbandry, ye are Gods building.</hi> All is but <hi>one</hi> body, <hi>one</hi> common wealth but with this diſtinction, that ſome in this Body and commonweath, are <hi>labourers,</hi> ſome whoſe charge it is to <hi>plant,</hi> and <hi>ſovv</hi> the ſeed, which are the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: others are the <hi>Husbandry,</hi> the field which is <hi>vvatered,</hi> and receiues the ſeed, whichs the flock.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe Premiſſes I diſcourſe thus: as it is impoſſible that God, laying an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon vs of belieuing reuealed Truths, should not haue afforded vs the neceſſary means to know what Truths he has reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſo it is a madneſs in me to expect to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41955:34"/>come to that knowledge by any other way or means, than by that which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it's an vnqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable truth, that God might haue eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed an other manner of Prouidence for the ſaluation of man whitout Scripture Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments or Church; but if God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in this his preſent gouernment, not to ſaue Man but vpon certain conditions, will you be ſo peremptory as to expect by ſpecial priuiledge, as a perſon particularly fauored, to walk a path by yourſelf, and be exempted from thoſe conditions which are generally required fromall? God might do ſo, there is no doubt of it; but it's a madneſs in you to expect it.</p>
               <p>You are to enquire what worship God requires from Man; what truths he has reuealed; which is the true ſence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: I do not doubt, but God might, if he were pleaſed, vſe other means for your inſtruction, without Church, Scripture, Paſtors or Doctors, ſnatching you to the Third Heauen as hedid S. Paul 2. Cor. 11.4. or by ſending an Angel to reſolue your doubts; or by inward illuſtrations and diuine lights: but ſince that in this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Prouidence he has eſtablished a Church, furnished as wee mentioned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41955:35"/>with Doctors, Paſtors, Apoſtles, and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts; and layd an obligation vpon her to teach you, and vpon you to belieue and obey her; will you as a perſon particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuiledg'd, expect to haue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what you ought to belieue, and to yet the true ſence of Scripture by any other means; than by and from that Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which God has appointed for the inſtruction of all? I pitty ſome deluded ſouls who ery out, <hi>God knovvs if I did knovv the true Religion, and the true ſence of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, I vvould embrace it.</hi> But, friend, do you expect a reuelation from Heauen, or an inward light for to aſcertain you? God has afforded means for to inſtruct vs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vs all (he excepts none) to heare and oby her, which is the Church: make vſe of the means which he has appointed, and you will be inſtructed: think not that your ignorance will excuſe your incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of what you ought to belieue; when God has giuen you means wherby to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and you will not make vſe of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe means; and if you ſay you do not know, which Church is that, which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for your inſtruction; both by what I haue already diſcourſed, and what shall be ſaid in the enſuing chapters, it will

               <p>But, ſay you, I ſearch the Scripture, as Chriſt commanded, 10.5.39. and what I meet not there, I do not belieue; becauſe I am perſuaded it's it that God has left vnto vs for to inſtruct vs; and that it contains ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and cleerly, what wee are bound to belieue. But wee haue proued in the two former chapters, that Scripture does not contain all articles which wee are bound to belieue; and that euen the fundamental points of Religion, are not ſufficiently proued by Scripture alone without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faillible interpreter: for there is not any text hardly of Scripture but may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in different ſences, and Scripture alone does not aſcertain vs, which is the true ſence: And if an Heretick did aryſe, and ſay, that it is not lawfull to keepe ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day for a Holy day, but ſaturday; becauſe God commanded this should be kept, and the Apoſtles could not alter it againſt the expreſs command of God, Ex. 20. if he should ſay, that it is lawfull for vs to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe but one Holy day and no more in the weeke, and that wee are obliged to work the other ſix dayes according that text, <hi>ſix dayes thou shalt vvork, but the ſeaueth is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41955:36"/>the Sabaoth of they Lord,</hi> Ex. 20. can his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be eleerly proued by Scripture alone? if he should ſay, that it is not conformable to the inſtruction of Chriſt, to giue the Communion to Women, becauſe wee do not read that Chriſt should haue giuen it to any; by what Scripture will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince him of an error? If he should ſay, that you cannot in conſcience defend your right againſt one who commences a ſuit in law againſt you, or that is an vniuſt vſurper of your goods; he will giue you plain Scripture for it: <hi>To him that vvill conteſt vvith you in Lavv, and take your Coat from you, giue him alſo your Cloak:</hi> Mat. 5.40. and by what text will you conuince him, that he misvnderſtands that text? if he should ſay with the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> that a Prieſt who would apoſtatiſe from his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ought not to be receiued again to the Communion of the Church, though he did repent, grounded vpon the words of Chriſt, Mat. 5. <hi>if the ſalt</hi> (that's to ſay the Doctors and Paſtors of the Church) <hi>hath loſt its Sauour, vvher vvith shall it be ſalted? it is therfore good for nothing but to be caſt out, and trod vnder foot of men.</hi> This is a damnable error, the doore is ſtill open M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sall, if you will but knock with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41955:36"/>yet no text of Scripture doth cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuince that errour; finally there was neuer yet any Hereſy, no neuer will be, but will hit vpon ſome text of Scripture to proue its error: and if it be lawfull for euery man to interpret he Scripture in the ſence that ſeems beſt to him, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be conuinced by Scripture alone.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that ſince the texts of Scripture admit different ſences; either of two things muſt happen; or that God has left it arbitrary to Mankind, to belieue that ſence, which each one <hi>bonafide</hi> thinks in his own iudgment to be the beſt; and has not obliged him to ſubmit his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſence giuen by any other; and if ſo, Arriants, Proteſtants, Catholiks and all are of a good Religion; for each of vs belieues that ſence of Scripture which wee think the trueſt, which is all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Or if God has obliged vs all, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue one ſence of Scripture, though that ſence may not ſeem the beſt to this, or that particular man; and will haue vs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our iudgments and belieue that ſence, which he obliges vs all to belieue; if ſo, then God muſt haue appointed ſome ſuprem Autority to declare vnto vs, what ſence is that, which he will haue vs all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41955:37"/>belieue; to which all diſſenting Parties muſt aſſent, and ſubmit their iudgment: for it were vnbecoming the goodneſs of God to oblige man vnder pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to belieue one ſence, and no other of all the different ſences the letter of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re admits; and not to afford ſom aſſured means and publick Authority (for no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat authority will ſuffice) to propoſe vnto vs, what ſence it that. Nor will it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep vs in Vnity of Faith, without this ſuprem Authority, for its not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue Vnity of Faith, if wee do not all hold one and the ſame ſenee of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: nor it is poſſible that wee all hold the ſame ſence, if there be not a publick Authority for to propoſe vnto vs what ſence is it, that wee muſt hold, to whoſe iudgment wee muſt be all bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce; for if it be lawfull for euery man to reiect that Authority, and hold that ſence of Scripture which he iudges the beſt; it will be lawfull for euery man to liue in a different Religion from that of others, and ſo there will neuer be any Vnity of Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>Now that the ſuprem Authority appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt for to decide our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, and deliuer vnto vs the true ſence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41955:37"/>of Scripture, is the Church eſtablisht by Chriſt, its proued by the texts of Scripture alleadged in the beginning of this Chap. its proued alſo by the practiſe of all ages; for when in the Apoſtles dayes there aroſe a controuerſy about the Circumciſion of the Gentils ſom affirmed they ought, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be baptiſed, but alſo circumciſed; others denyed the Neceſſity, of Circumciſion; both Parties alleadged Scripture, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was appayed: and how was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy decided and the true ſence of Scripture alleadged by both, propoſed; by the Church conuened in a Council at Ieruſalem. Act. 15. the one Party was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Hereticks if they did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and acquieſce to the Doctrin propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Church. About the yeare 324. aroſe a diſpute betwit Arrius, (that was a member of the Catholick Church, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo Catholicks, concerning the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt; each of the diſputants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged ſeueral texts of Scripture, and pretended his own, to be the true ſence: who decided this Controuerſy? was it the Scripture alone without a publick authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to propoſe the ſence of it? No, but the Church, gathered in the Nicen Council, to whoſe deciſions all Chriſtians were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41955:38"/>bound to acquieſce, and condemned as Hereticks that would not. About the yeare 378. aroſe a diſpute between Macedonius and other Catholicks concerning the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the H. G. which he denied; both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cited many texts of Scripture, but the diſpute was not ended vntill the Church, gathered in a Council at Conſtantinople, examined that queſtion and texts produced by both Conteſtants, and concluded againſt Macedonius: after which Deciſion it was not lawfull to doubt of the Diuinity of the H. G. To be brief look into all ages that euer any queſtion aroſe concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the final deciſion was alluayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued to the Church, who deliuered the true ſence of Scripture quoted by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants, and eſteemed an Heretick that did not ſubmit. This shews that the world did euer yet belieue, the ſuprem authority of deciding controuerſies, and deliuering the true ſenſe of Scripture was ſtill in the Church.</p>
               <p>But the wery Proteſtants themiſelues, who decry the Church, and will haue no other Iugde of Controuerſies but Scripture, do confeſs that betwixt two Parties prouing their differents Aſſertions of Religion out of Scripture, the Church hath the ſuprem
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41955:38"/>authority of deciding, and deliuering the true ſence of Scripture, to which both Parties are obliged in conſcience to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce: read Doctor Porter in his Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of <hi>Char.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arminius</hi> a Miniſter of Amſterdam and Profeſſor of Diuinity at Leyden, broached new Doctrin, touching points of <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Grace</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> quite contrary to the Doctrin of Caluin, receiued in the

               <p>
                  <hi>Armenius</hi> dyed ſoon after, but his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers took vp the cudgle, and gain'd ſo much ground vpon the <hi>Gomariſts,</hi> that all the three Prouinces of <hi>Holland, Vtrecht,</hi> and <hi>Oueriſſel</hi> embraced their fiue Articles; and pretended a petition to the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for a toleration in the profeſſion of that Doctrin, which they offered to defend with the pure word of God: adding, it did not appertain to a National Synod but to the Diuins of each particular Prouince to take cogniſance of the affairs of Religion in that Prouince, and therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt any National Synod. The <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariſts</hi> on the other ſyde cryed out for a Synod: the controuerſy did not only trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the peace of the Prouinces, but made a great <hi>Ecco</hi> in the neigh bouring Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churchs.

                  <hi>Dudley Carleton,</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the States that the only means for to allay thoſe diſputes was a National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, to whom it belonged to iudge which of the Doctrins controuerted was the moſt conformable to the word of God, and if both could be toletated in the Church; and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41955:40"/>therefore demanded a Synod. <hi>Zeland</hi> and the other Prouinces demanded the ſame; as alſo the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> the Commonwealth of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and generally all the Reformed Churchs. All this paſſage is faithfully extracted, <hi>ex Act. Synodi Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drectani, Typis Iſaaci Ioannis Canicy</hi> printed at Dordtecht an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dom. 1620.</p>
               <p>Heervpon the States General iſſued their circular letters to all the Prouinces requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that each should ſend ſix of their beſt Diuines to Dordrecht, were the Synod was open'd the 13.

And though the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of France were not permitted to go thither, they ſent their iudgment of the queſtion debated, in writing. The <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> proteſted againſt the Synod, as being a Partie concerned; and conſequently not a competent Iudge, being compoſed of Perſons confeſſedly of the doctrin of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41955:40"/>Gomariſts. (was it not thus that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers proteſted againſt the Council of Trent.) The deputies of te extern Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deliuered in writing their opinions of this proteſtation: Thoſe of <hi>England;</hi> that it was againſt the practice of the primitiue Church; of the Councils of <hi>Nice, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, Chalcedo,</hi> and <hi>Epheſe,</hi> whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were confeſſedly of the Catholick Church, oppoſed by <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches;</hi> that not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were competent iudges, againſt whom no proteſtation was admitted, but all Parties were obliged to ſubmit. The Diuins of <hi>Palatin;</hi> that to determin a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy in Religion, the Parties muſt not go to the Turks or Pagans, or to indifferent Perſons, that profeſs no Religion; but muſt be ſaid by the Paſtors and Prelats of that Church, wherof they are members, and wherin the queſtion is debated. The Diuins of <hi>Geneua,</hi> that both Parties were by the ſentence of Chriſt bound to ſubmit to the Synod, or to be eſteemed Heathens and Publicans. All the reſt of the Diuins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ſame; whervpon the Synod condemned that proteſtation, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it ſelf to be the lawfull and ſoueraign Iudge in that cauſe; <hi>Vel abycere debent om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

The <hi>Armeniens</hi> were then ſummoned to waue the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and giue in writing their fiue arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which they did; they were examined by the Synod, and condemned as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and contrary to the word of God; and all thoſe that would ſuſtain them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated for to beare any charge, or exerciſe any Eccleſiaſticall function, Seſſ. 138.</p>
               <p>The Armeniens did not ſubmit to this iudgment alleadging the Synod (as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) was fallible, and did err in this point, and therefore could not be obliged in conſcience to ſubmit; and perhaps ſome Proteſtants will ſyde with them, ſaying that a Councill can not oblige mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and that their Decrees can reach no further, than to what concerns the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41955:41"/>Politick gouernment of the flock: but this Synod, which indeed was more than a National one, of the Reformed Churchs, and aſſiſted by the deputyes of the Church of England, declares an obligation in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> of acquieſcing to its deciſions, not only by the words now alleaged, but by the Seſſ. 42. <hi>Si conſcientiae ſuae (quam debent) oationem habent, ad obtemperandum ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Poteſtatum mandatis, hujuſque Synodi ordini &amp; iudicio acquieſcendum tenentur.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41955:42"/>credendum eſt,</hi> it muſt be vndoubtedly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that Chriſt according his promiſs, was preſent to that meeting, and gouern'd it, by the Holy Ghoſt Iudic. Syn. Deſph. Seſſ. 26. Syn. Dord. And if the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils reach not to oblige Conſciences, then Arrius muſt not be iudged an Heretick though condemned by the Council of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, nor can M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall belieue S. Athanaſius his Creed with the heauenly gift of Faith wherwhith he belieues the Scripture, as he acknowledges, pag. 18.</p>
               <p>Now whateuer any particular Doctor or Doctors of the Church of England ſay; what Pagan, would enquire into the Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Chriſtian Religion with a deſire of being inſtructed, would reade this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> and <hi>Delpht,</hi> and alſo the Councils of Nice and all other General Councils of the Catholick Church, and would not vnderſtanding, that it is the Doctrin and practice of both Church the Reformed and Catholick, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils haue the ſuprem Authority of deciding Controuerſies, and deliuering the true ſence of Scripture; that none can proteſt againſt the authority of Councils legally aſſembled; and that both Parties conteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about any point of Religion, is to be

               <p>Hence it follows M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, that wheras there was no Chriſtian Church viſible, when your firſt Reformers oppoſed the Catholick Tenets, but the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; They were obliged to be iudged by her, andſubmit their doctrin to her iudgment, they being Members of that Church; that in declining her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Council of Trent, and proteſting againſt her, as being a Partie, and fallible; they became Schiſmaticks. And if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in its of spring was ſchiſmatical, doubtleſs in their continuation it muſt be ſo, for tyme giues no preſcription to an errour, nor haue you more right to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that ſeparation from vs, than your firſt Reformers had to begin it.

               <p>Now let vs heare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall what means did he vſe to vnderſtand the true ſence of Scripture; to ſatisfy his doubts in Religion, and to know what he ought to belieue; and wee will find he did not vſe the means

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41955:44"/>this which your inſtructors omitted, has been shewen vnto you in this Chapter, not only by Scripture and reaſon, but by the practiſe of your Reformed Churchs repreſented in the Synod of Dordrecht; that when two Conteſtants draw contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory conſequences out of Scripture, each one pretending his own to be vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably deduc'd out of the Text, the Church wherof the Parties are Members, has the ſuprem Authority to reſolue which is the true conſequence; that the Parties are bound in conſcience to ſubmit to her iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to be held for Schiſmatiks if they do not: and wheras your firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers drew conſequences which ſeemed to them to follow vndubitably from Scripture, and their Aduerſaryes iudged the contrary to be vndubitable true; your Reformers were bound to ſubmit to the Catholik Church wherof theyr were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and learne of her which were the true conſequences, and were Schiſmatick for not doing ſo; and as their errour deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to you and your liuing Brethren; the obligation alſo of being inſtructed by the Catholik Church, and acquieſcing to her iudgment deſcends vnto you. And thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall you miſerably miſtooke the means
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41955:45"/>which Chriſt appointed for to inſtruct vs in Religion.</p>

               <head>V. CHAPTER. <hi>THE CHVRCH ESTABLISHED FOR our inſtruction, is infallible.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough I reſerue a chapter a part for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls arguments againſt this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, yet I muſt heere toucth two of them, which shew that he is either ignorant, or malicious in miſtaking our doctrin, by the anſwer to which I will declare, what wee belieue in this particular. He impugns our doctrin from the pag. 29. to 35. and from the pag. 39. to 44. pag. 39. he argues that Infallibility is an <hi>Attribut</hi> proper to Gods <hi>eſſence,</hi> which can no more be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to any Creature, than the <hi>Deyty</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; its a Blaſphemy, ſaies he, to attribute to any creature, that which is proper to God alone; conſequenty the Church of Rome is guilty of Blaſphemy in teaching the Pope or Council is infallible. I cannot belieue but that you are ſufficienty ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the weakneſs of this argument, which from the very beginning of your
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41955:45"/>pretended Reformation is ſo common, that any Collier will anſwer it; eſpecially that it, and all the arguments you bring in your whole diſcourſe are exactly ſet down in Bellarmin, (whence you haue bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed them) and moſt euidently anſw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered; and if you had any ingenuity you ought not to trouble your Auditory with ſuch third bare tryfles, but tell them alſo, what wee anſwer; and retort it if you could. Can you that pretends to the credit of a Profeſſor of Diuinity, ignore, that a man, who is by his own Nature <hi>Mortal,</hi> might by Gods Protection, (who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him, he shall neuer dye) be <hi>immortal?</hi> and why will you deny but that Man, who by Nature is ſubiect to errour, may by Gods ſpecial protection, (promiſing him that he shall neuer err) be kept from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into any errour or miſtake? This is what wee belieue, that the Church, which is by Nature (as being a congregation of Men) fallible, may be miſtaken, and though ignorance or malice teach an vntruth, but that God has promiſed to aſſiſt her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with his ſpirit, for to leade her into all Truth; and neuer to permit her to teach or belieue any errour: by virtue of wich promiſs (iudge you if ſuch a promiſs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41955:46"/>be impoſſible) wee ſay the Church cannot err in her doctrin, which is to be infallible.</p>
               <p>Dare you deny, but that the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in what they taught and writ? dare you deny but that the Church of God is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in fundamental points of Religion? and are you therefore guilty of Blaſphemy, or do you intrench on Gods prerogatiues, or giue his Attributs to creatures? God is infallible by Nature; by his own proper perfection, this is his Attribut; and this cannot be giuen to any creature: to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible by the protection of an other, who defends him from falling into any errour, is not Attribut of God, it were a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſay that he is infallible in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but the Prophets, Apoſtles, Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and the Church are thus infallible, by Gods ſpecial protection and the conduct of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>An other argument againſt our Tenet. pag. 30. is the diſagreement of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in placing this infallibity: ſome will haue it to be in the Pope alone; others in him and a Council of Cardinals; others in the Pope and General Council alone. This diſſention is to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall a concluding argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that there is no ſuch thing as Church
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41955:46"/>infallibity: and thus he furnishes the <hi>Deiſts</hi> with a concluding argument, that there is no ſuch thing as true Religion in the world; for, will the <hi>Deiſts</hi> ſay with him; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that pretend to true Religion, do not agree where it is; ſome ſay its in the Iewish Church; others that it is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, others in the Catholik Church; others in other Congregations; and will conclude in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls Dialect; that there is no ſuch thing as true Religion extant, becauſe the Pretenders to it, do not agree where to find it. But the poore Man, ignorantly or maliciously miſtakes our doctrin: all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks do agree in the infallibility of the Pope and General Council ioyntly, this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility wee belieue as an article of Faith.</p>
               <p>Its true, that the Catholik Authors do diſpute if the Pope alone is infallible; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſay he is, and will haue it to be an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith that he is; others ſay that he is not, but with a Council of Cardinals and Diuines; others ſay, that neither this is an article of Faith; ſome ſay that a General Council legally aſſembled is infallible in their Decrees, though not confirmed by the Pope; others ſay not, if they be not confirmed by him. But all theſe are but ſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hool queſtions; the Church heares them,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41955:47"/>and permits them to diſpute: and whateuer Bellarmin or any other ſaies, wee are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to belieue it to be an article of faith whylſt it is oppoſed by other Catholick Doctors and the Church does not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the Controuerſy: but what you are to obſerue is; that thoſe Doctors who defend the infalliblity of the Pope alone; and thoſe that deny it; thoſe that affirm the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Council alone, and thoſe that contradict it, they agree vnanimously in the infallibity of the Pope and Council toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe that with out any controuerſy the Pope and Council ioyintly, repreſents the vniuerſal Church; and the vniuerſal Church is infallible: this is the article of Faith wee belieue. And if you tell vs, a Pope, or a General Council has err'd; you will tell vs nothing to the purpoſe, if you do not shew that a Pope and Council to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether has err'd: for that's the Church, hauing by the anſwer of theſe two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, declared what infallibility the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch clayms, and where wee belieue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to be, let vs now proue our Tenet.</p>
               <p>Firſt, its a comfort to an vnacquainted Traueller to be guided by one whom he firmly belieues to be acquainted with the way: though really your guide were not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41955:47"/>acquainted with the way, if you certainly belieue he is, and that he cannot ſtray; though you do not know the way your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you will follow him with ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without feare of being byaſs'd: but if you do not know the way, and you belieue your guide is not ſo well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that he may ſtray; you will ſtill trauell with feare of being byaſs'd. This is the different condition of a Catholik and a Proteſtant: the Catholick trauelling in the way to ſaluation, (which is Religion) is guided by a Church, which he, without the leaſt doubt, belieues cannot be miſtaken; whether she can or not, ſince he is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly perſwaded she cannot, he trauells with ſatisfaction and without feare: the Proteſtant in this way, is guided by a Church, which he belieues, is not ſo well aſſured of the way, but that she may err; ought he not therefore to walk diſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, and with continual feare of being miſlead?</p>
               <p>You anſwer that the Proteſtant is not lead by the Church, but by the Scripture; which is an infallible guide. Its very ſure, the Scripture is infallible, vnderſtood in the true ſence, but you can haue no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that you haue the true ſence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41955:48"/>conſequently you can haue no aſſurance, that you haue an infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de; this propoſition is certain: <hi>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ill interpreted, does mislead:</hi> this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is alſo certain, <hi>you, and your Church may err, in the interpretation of Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring one text vvith an other.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your guide in the road of Faith, is the Scripture interpreted by you, and your Church, comparing on text with an other. You are guided by a guide, that may err and mislead you; and as you haue no well grounded aſſurance, that you and your Church do not err in the interpretation of Scripture, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring one text with an other; you can haue no aſſurance but that you are mislead. But the Catholik belieuing his Church to be infallible in the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, does reſt his mind in the full aſſurance of the truth he profeſſeth.</p>
               <p>And ought not you to embrace that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, which giues you that ſatisfaction, and reſt of mind; rather than the Proteſtant doctrin of fallibility, which leaues you doubtfull, if what you belieue be true or not? Particularly when in belieuing it, you hazard nothing: not your ſaluation; for all learned Proteſtants (which wee will proue againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall) do grant ſaluation
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41955:48"/>in the expreſs beliefe of articles of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; you reply, its no ſolid comfort, that the Catholik amuſes himſelf with, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing his Church that guides him to be infallible, if really she be not ſo: for if it proues in effect to be otherwiſe, he will come short of his imaginary comfort, and will find that he and his Church is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. I anſwer, if wee conſider the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture, the ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the conſent of ages, the multitude of Vniuerſityes Fathers and Doctors that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this doctrin of infallibility; it is as lykely to be true as your doctrin of falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; its as lykely that you are miſtaken in belieuing fallibility, as I am in belieuing infallibility: you run therefore as great a hazard of being miſtaken as I do: on the other ſyde, you cannot haue that ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without feare of being mislead; that reſt of mind, in the aſſurance of the truth (for you may err) by belieuing fallibility, as I haue by belieuing infallibility: my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then is ſtill better than yours, and my doctrin to be prefered before yours.</p>
               <p>Your Church, as you confeſs may err in points of Religion, whence it manifeſtly follows that it is not the true ſence of Scripture, that leads you in the road to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41955:49"/>Religion; for the true ſence of Scripture is abſolutly infallible: I ask you therefore, on what do you ground your Faith? You tell me, that vpon the Scripture as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by your Church, and comparing one text with an other; but it may happen that your Church may err in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; that you confeſs, for you ſay the true Church may err, now I argue thus: whoeuer may err, relying vpon a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; can neuer be ſure that he does not err, whylſt he relyes only on that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: this propoſition is vndeniable; for if he can err relying on that Principle; its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Principle is fallible, and if the Principle be fallible, it alone without the help of ſome other, can neuer giue any aſſurance that you do not err: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple you belieue the King is in London be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an honeſt Man tells you ſo; that is a fallible ground, which you rely on, and you may err by relying on that ground, and as long as you rely only on that mans teſtimony, and haue no other; you will neuer be aſſured of the Kings being at London. You belieue the Church fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and on what ground do you rely? on Scripture as interpreted by the Church: you may err relying on this Principle as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41955:49"/>you confeſs; therefore as long as you rely on this Principle only, and haue no other, you can neuer be aſſured that you do not err: the Church of England has no other, nor will admit no other Principle to ground their Faith vpon, but the Scripture interpreted by her, and comparing one text with an other therefore she can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be aſſured of the doctrin she belieues; conſequently cannot be aſſured of the fallibility of the true Church.</p>
               <p>What will you ſay in this caſe: there is a Man accuſed of Murther before your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, he does not only deny the fact, but many circumſtances fauours his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the very Perſon that accuſes him ſaies, he is not ſure, he is the Murtherer: ſurely you would not condemn this Man to death; it being againſt all the maxims of iuſtice to punish a man that is not conuic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted criminal. This is the very matter in hand: the true Church is accuſed of falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and falshood in her doctrin; the circumſtances of hauing florished for ſo many ages, in the credit of an infallible Oracle, fauors her innocency, and her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, which is the Church of England, does confeſs that she may err in her accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and conſequently muſt confeſs, as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41955:50"/>wee proued, that she cannot be ſure, she does not err; for she grounds her accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Scripture interpreted by her, in which she may err; and whylſt she has no other Principle but that, she can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be certain she does not err: will not you then acquit the Church, of whoſe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me her accuſer is not ſure, as you would that Man accuſed of Murther?</p>
               <p>Add this diſcourſe to the former: it is a Principle in all well gouerned Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealhs, that a preacable Poſſeſſor is not to be diſturbd from his poſſeſſion, vntill that by vnqueſtionable proofs he be conuicted an vniuſt vſurper or detainer; no coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor probable reaſons will put him out of poſſeſſion: he will ſtill with a ſafe conſcience maintain it; and the law will continue him in it, vntill that by euident proofs he be conuicted. The true Church was in all ages in peacable poſſeſſion of this prerogatiue of infallibility, neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to her, but by ſome few condemned Heretiks: what euident vnqueſtionable proofs can you bring to conuince her an vniuſt vſurper or detainer of it? Reaſon affords you none, for to ſay that infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an Attribut proper to God, is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; wheras she clayms no other infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41955:50"/>but ſuch as you grant to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles and Euangeliſts: but, ſay you, in a General Council, which is a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Men, where a point of Religion is to be reſolued by the maior part of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: and where paſſion, and intereſt ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes may ſway, it may happen, that an errour may haue more Abettors, and truth be out voted: This is to ſay that God has no Prouidence ouer his Church: ſince he has promiſed the conduct of his infallible ſpirit to her, for to lead her into all truth, and keep her vnſpotted from all errours; let each particular of that multitude be euer ſo corrupt in himſelf: God, who can as eaſily gouern the harts of many, as of one; will not permit them to determin an errour, nor truth to be out voted. Was not the Council of the Apoſtles and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients at Ieruſalem a multitude? Were not the firſt four General Concils multitudes, which the Proteſtants confeſs to haue been infallible, and guided by Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which was as neceſſary to the Councils of ſucceeding ages, the emergent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſyes being no fewer in number, nor leſs in weight.</p>
               <p>Neither does Scripture afford you any: match, if you can theſe texts: <hi>I am vvith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41955:51"/>you all the dayes, untill the conſummation of the vvorld</hi> Math. 28.20. and if the Church did teach an vntruth, would Chriſt be with her then? <hi>He vvill give you an other Paraclet the Spirit of Truth, that vvill abyde vvith you for euer; vvho vvill leade you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth.</hi> Io. 14.16. <hi>vvhen the Paraclet vvill come, vvhom I vvill ſend from my Father, the Spirit of truth, he vvill giue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of me, and you vvill giue teſtimony:</hi> Io. 15.26. the Paraclet and the Chruch, are ioynt Witneſſes of the truth.</p>
               <p>Nor does experience fauor you: all that you can shew is that ſome Pope did err, or that ſome Council did err; but thats not to the purpoſe, if you do not shew (which you will neuer do) thal a Pope and Council together has erred. wheras therefore neither ſcripture, Reaſon, nor experience doth afford you any vnqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable evident proofs, that the Chruch is an vnuiſt vſurper or detainer of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of infaillibility, which she has en ioyed in all ages, why will you pretend to diſturb her peacable poſſeſſion?</p>
               <p>Let vs heare what the ſcripture ſuyes: Lu. 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me:</hi> Chriſt ſpoke to his Apoſtles and Diſciples on whom he layd the charge of teaching
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41955:51"/>and preaching, and who were the Church repreſentatiue: whateuer therefore wee heare from the Chruch repreſentatiue, wee heare it from Chriſt; whateuer the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch ſpeaks, Chriſt ſpeaks, otherwyſe wee should not heare Chriſt ſpeak, when wee heare the Church ſpeake: the Church the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, is the Mouth by which Chriſt ſpeaks: and as we cannot heare an vntruth from him, as he cannot ſpeak any, ſo she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeake, nor be heard to ſpeake an vntruth: this is de clared by S. Paul 1. Theſ. 2.13. <hi>vvhen you receiued from vs the vvord of the hearing of God, you receiued it, not as the vvord of Man, but as indeed it is, the vvord of God.</hi> And therefore ſayes he 1. Theſ. 4. <hi>S. he that deſpeiſeth theſe things, deſpeiſeth not man, but God.</hi> Could a man ſpeake more pertinently to ſignify that the doctrin of the Church is the doctrin of God; that when wee heare her, we heare him; and that her words are infaillible, wheras they are the words of God?</p>
               <p>Obſerve that the Council of Apoſtles and Ancients at Ieruſalem. Act. 15.28. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding the Controuerſy concerning Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, delivers their ſentence thus; <hi>It ſeemeth good to ihe Holy Ghoſt and to vs.</hi> Signifying that the reſolution proceeded
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41955:52"/>ioyntly from both; from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> by his inward inſpiration and direction; from the Council, by its outward decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: can wee doubt therefore, but that the reſolution of Controuerſyes by that Council was infallibly true; and not only of that, but alſo of all ſucceeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; wheras the Apoſtles pronounced their ſentence in thoſe words, grounded on the words of Chriſt, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me,</hi> grounded on the words of Chriſt Io. 15.26. <hi>vvhen the Paraclet vvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l come, he shall giue teſtimony of me and you shall give teſtimony;</hi> in which words Chriſt did ſpeak to his Church, which was the witneſs, which ioyntly with the Holy Ghoſt, was to giue teſtimony of him; and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Promiſs of his Paraclet, which was made by Chriſt, not only to the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, but to his Church for euer, <hi>vntill the conſummation of the vvorld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is yet more cleerly proved by the following diſcourſe: Chriſt commands vs to heare the Church; that he that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peiſeth her deſpeiſeth him Lu. 10.16. to obſerue and do what thoſe that ſit on Moyſes his chayre, bids vs do Mat. 23.2. commands them to be eſteemed as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> and <hi>Publicans,</hi> that will not obey her.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41955:52"/>S. Paul commands vs (Heb. 13.17.) not to be carried away with various and ſtrang Doctrins, but obey the Church, wherin ſayes he, Eph. 4. God has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Doctors and Paſtors to teach vs: out of theſe and the lyke texts, (which are frequent in ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,) largue thus. He that does what Chriſt bids him do, and belieues what he bids him belieue; cannot do amiſs, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue an errour: but Chriſt bids vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue and do, what the Church commands vs to belieue and do, as appeares by the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe texts; therefore he that does what the Church commands him to do, and belieues what she commands vs to belieue; cannot do amiſs nor belieue an errour: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently what teuer the Church teachs is no errour.</p>
               <p>To conclude. S. Io. 1. epiſ. 4.6. hauing warned vs to try our Spirits, if from God or Satan; he gives vs a rule wherby to try them; <hi>he that knovveth God heareth vs, he that knovveth not God, heareth vs not. In this vve knovv the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of errour.</hi> This is the way preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by S. Iohn to aſcertain vs of the nature of our Spirits: if our Spirit be conformable to the Spirit of the Church,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41955:53"/>its a Spirit of Truth; if it does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form itſelf to the Spirit of the Church; its a Spirit of errour: but if the Spirit of the Church de fallible, it can give me no aſſurance of my Spirit, whether it be of truth or of errour: for what aſſurance can you haue, that the Cloath which you meaſure is of a yard in length; if you be not aſſured, that the yard wherwith you meaſure, it is an exact yard? neither the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore can you be aſſured that your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is of truth by trying it with the Spirit of the Church; if you be not aſſured that the Spirit of the Church is of Truth.</p>
               <p>But becauſe our Aduerſaries, will ſtill reply that all this is to be vnderſtood of the Apoſtles, who were infallible whylſt they liued, and are now infallible in their written word: I haue already shewen that the written word is not ſufficient to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain vs of the truth or vntruth of our Spirits, and will now proue in this.</p>

Athanaſius his <hi>Creed</hi> (paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelling this wth the other two) <hi>vvith the heauenly gift of faith;</hi> and if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Nice, which deliuered vnto vs the doctrin contained in Athanaſius his Creed, had not been directed by the Holy Ghoſt, as the Writers of the ſcripture were; it were à Blaſphemy to belieue that Creed, and the doctrin of the Council with the ſame Faith, with which wee belieue the ſcripture. Now the Proteſtants all agree in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41955:54"/>this; that now, nor in theſe many ages, the Church is not infallible; for which aſſertion, you muſt expect no ſcripture from them, nor no reaſon, but their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re word.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſee what reaſon they pretend: God, ſay they, having giuen vs an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble written word, ſufficient to inſtruct vs, Church infallibility was for the future needleſs; what ſchool boy but ſees the weakneſs of this reaſon? firſt, after the ſcripture was written, the Church conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued infallible for ſome ages, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall muſt confeſs by what I haue now ſaid; as generally all Proteſtants ſay; and as all, muſt ſay, otherwyſe <hi>Arrius,</hi> and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiarks, might have queſtioned the truth of their doctrin if they had been fallible; and could not be obliged in conſcience to acquieſce to their iugdment, nor ought not tobe held for Hereticks nor excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for not ſubmitting to them, if they were fallible; as yon do not eſteem yourſelf an Heretick for not ſubmitting to the Catolick Church on te ſame account. S. Gregory l. 1. c. 24. ſayes of the firſt four Councils <hi>I do embrace and reuerence the four General Councils, as the four Books of the Ghoſpell;</hi> which had been rashly and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41955:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>impiously ſaid, if they had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Secondly if Church infallibility was needbeſs becauſe the ſcripture, which is infallible, was written; then it was alſo needleſs that the Church should be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in fundamental points of Religion; and yet Proteſtants do conſtantly auer, that the Church is ſtill infallible in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points, thought he ſcripture be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible alſo in them. Thirdly, the Apoſtles remayned ſtill infallible after the Scripture was written; and why not the Church? fourthly, if infallibility is needleſs, becauſe the Scripture is infallible, wee may ſay alſo that S Iohn is not infallible in is Ghos pell, at leaſt, as to thoſe points which were al ready mentioned in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, and Luke; or that theſe three, loſt their infallibility by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of S. Iohns Ghos pell; becauſe one infallible Ghos pell is ſufficient, at leaſt as to the points it contains.</p>
               <p>Theſe inſtances shew that reaſon to be very friuolous: and if it proued any thing, at moſt it can proue that the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is not <hi>neceſſary</hi> for our <hi>inſtruction;</hi> but it might be-neceſſary for other ends of Gods prouidence; who might haue left ſtill that gift of infallibility to his Church,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41955:55"/>for a mark of his loue to her. wee find he did promiſe the conduct of his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit to his Church; wee de not find he should haue limited this grace to any tyme; nay to the contrary, wee find that he ſayd, it should be <hi>for euer, all dayes, to the conſummation of the vvorld,</hi> why should wee therfore limit that fauor vnto à ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; to conclude wee haue proued in the 2 and 3 chap. that Scripture is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to inſtruct vs, and conſequently an infallible Church is ſtill neceſſary.</p>
               <p>An other reaſon no leſs ſilly, to proue that the Church after few ages became fallible: for the Popes. Prelats, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple became very vicious; and from the debauchery of manners, they came, by Gods iuſt iugdment, to fall into errours in doctrin: which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall pretends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue by Scripture pag. 32. <hi>the promiſe made by Chriſt of the Paraclet, for to lead the Church into all truth, vvas a conditional promiſe as appears by Chriſt his vvord</hi> Io. 14.16. <hi>if you loue me, keep my commandmens, and I vvill ask my father, and he vvill giue you an other Paraclet, that he may abyde vvith you for euer; euen the Spirit of Truth, vvhom the vvorld cannot receiue.</hi> The Paraclet is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed on condition they Keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41955:55"/>and by the later words, <hi>vvhom the vvorld cannot receiue;</hi> the Paraclet is flatly denied to all thoſe, the Scripture ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les by the name of <hi>vvorld;</hi> that is to ſay, the, wicked and wordly men. Hence (ſayes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall wee can be no more ſure, that the Pope and his Council are infallible; than wee are that he liues in Gods loue, and obſeruance of his commandments: and wheras it is manifeſt by our own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoryes, that the Pope, Paſtors and flock haue fallen into many crimes, it followes they haue forfeited the conduct of Gods infaillible Spirit.</p>
               <p>If from the lewdneſs of manners, wee might conclude the Churches corruption in doctrin, what Ghoſpell could the world expect from Luther, and the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformers, for whoſe wickdneſs there are as good Records as for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of Popes and Prelats: the ſinns of Prelats did deface the Ghoſpell, and did the Apoſtaſy of Luther and the Sodomy of Caluin reſtore it to its ſplendor? Chriſt did foreſee that they, who should ſit on the chayre of Moyſes, would be wicked in their lyues; and yet commanded vs, to obey, and belieue their doctrin. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Gods Spirit promiſed to them, for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41955:56"/>to leade them into all Truth, was not a perſonal gift giuen to them for their own ſakes, but for the flock; for to keepe them in vnity of Faith: and therefore though God does permit them to fall into wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of lyfe, his Prouidence will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to fall into errors of doctrin; that the flock, which it obliged to obey them, may not be mislead. To proue that the Promiſs was only <hi>conditional,</hi> you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the text: for as well your Bible, as ours, ſayes thus: <hi>if you loue me, keepe my Commandments;</hi> and there puts a <hi>punctum.</hi> Then ads a diſtinct verſe or ſection; <hi>And I vvill ask my Father, and he vvill giue you an other Paraclet &amp;c.</hi> which makes an abſolut ſence, independent of the former. That this is the true interpretation of that text; it appears, for in ſeueral other texts, That aſſiſtance of as Mat. 28 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>behold I am vvith you all dayes, euen to the conſummation of the vvorld.</hi> Mat. 16. <hi>the Gates of hell shall not preuayle agaiuſt her.</hi> Io. 16 13. <hi>vvhen the Paraclet shall come the Spirit of Truth, he shall teach you-all truth.</hi> And is it not ſtrang M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall should auerr, the Paraclet was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vpon condition of Gods loue, and obſeruance of his Commandments; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras the Church remayns ſtill infallible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundamental
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41955:56"/>points; notwithſtanding that it has fayled in that condition, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall and all Proteſtants do deknowledge. But what he will neuer anſwer is, that if that Promiſs was conditional, it folloues wee cannot be ſure the Ghoſpell is infallible, if wee be not ſure that the Euangeliſts, when they wrote it, haue been in the loue of God, and obſeruance of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for if they were not, they had not the Paraclet ſayes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall; but no text of Scripture tells vs, that the Euangeliſts we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in the ſtate of Grace when they writ the Ghoſpell; nor nothing elſe giues vs aſſurance of it. Therefore wee are not aſſured the Ghoſpell written by the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts is infallible: nay which is worſe, in the common doctrin of Proteſtants, wee are aſſured it is not infaillible; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrin in their Church is, that it is impoſſible to keepe Gods commandments; the Euangeliſts therefore, when they writ did not keep Gods Commandments; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequenly they could not haue the Paraclet to lead them into truth; conſequenly the Ghoſpell is not infallible, and ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall ouerthrows all-Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>Let vs conſider what inducements had the primitiue Chriſtians to belieue the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41955:57"/>infallible: was it not the teſtimony of the Apoſtles, confirming their doctrin with many Miracles? look into the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of all ſucceding ages, and you will find, that the Church, which affirmed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be infallible, did confirm her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin with many and great Miracle, as wee will euidence in the enſuing Chap. And on what do you ground your beliefe, when you ſay the Apoſtles were infallible? You ſay, that vpon the Scripture: but I defy you to shew any text of Scripture which declares the infallibility of the Apoſtles, that relates not to the Church in ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ages, as well as to them; either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they proue the Church to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſucceeding ages, or they do not proue the Apoſtles to be infallible.</p>
               <p>For example wee proue the infallibility of the Apoſtles by the words of Chriſt: <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me.</hi> Lu. 10. whence followes, that the words of the Apoſtles were the words of Chriſt. But Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Mat. 18. declares that text muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his Church, whereuer it be: <hi>if he vvil not heare the Church, let him be to you as a Heathen and Publican.</hi> We proue it out of S. Iohn 14.18. <hi>He vvill giue you an other Paraclet, the ſpirit of truth, that vvill a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41955:57"/>byde vvith you for euer;</hi> but this text playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares that the Promiſs was made alſo to the Church in ſucceeding ages, by the word <hi>for euer;</hi> for the Apoſtles were not to be <hi>for euer</hi> in their own perſons, but in their ſucceſſors; and to remoue all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of cauilling vpon the word <hi>for euer,</hi> ſaying that it ſignifyes only the tyme of the Apoſtles lyues, Chriſt declares himſelf in a cleerer expreſſion, Mat. 28. <hi>I am vvith you all dayes to the conſummation of the vvorld</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs to vnd erſtand, that the Paraclet was not ſent to his Apoſtles alone, but to their ſucceſſors to the words end. Wee proue it by the text of S. Io. 16.26. <hi>vvhen the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclet vvill come, vvhom I vvill ſend from my Father the ſpirit of Truth, vvho proceedeth from the Father, he vvill giue teſtimony of me, and you vvill giue teſtimony.</hi> But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more cleer, than that the whole Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter ſpeakes all a long of the Church; (reade, y pray, the text) conſequently that text is to be vnderſtood of the Church, as well as of the Apoſtles. Wee proue it, becauſe the Apoſtles were the fundation (S. Paul Eph. 2.20.) whervpon the Church was built: But S. Paul calls the the Church alſo the Pillar and foundation of Truth 1. Tim. 3. Wee proue it becauſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41955:58"/>S. Paul commands vs in ſeueral places to belieue his doctrin, for that <hi>his vvord is not the vvord of Man, but indeed of God,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently infallible. 1. Theſ. 2. bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt alſo Mat. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commands vs to obey and belieue the Church in ſucceeding ages: <hi>on the chayr of Moyſes haue ſate the ſcribes and Phariſees, vvhateuer they bid you do, obſerue and do,</hi> obliging vs to obey and belieue not only Moyſes, but thoſe that <hi>ſucceede in his chayr.</hi> Thus not a text shall you meet for the infallibility of the Apoſtles, but proues lykwiſe that of the Church.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs you will not deny, but that Chriſt his Command of <hi>teaching all Nations, preaching the Ghoſpell,</hi> that <hi>the Bishops should rule the Church,</hi> was layd not only on the Apoſtles, but on their ſucceſſors for futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ages; other wyſe the Prelats and Paſtors of future, and this our age would not be obliged to <hi>teach preach,</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> vs. You will not deny alſo, but that Chriſt his command of hearing the Church vnder payn of being eſteemed Heathens and Publicans, of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that ſit on Moyſes his chayr, of being ſubiect to our Prelats, was layd on the flock of all ſucceeding ages, as well as on that of the Apoſtles dayes: it follows therefore that the Paſtors of our age are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41955:58"/>as much obliged to teach vs, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were to preach to them of their age; and that wee are as much obliged to obey and belieue the Church in our age, as the flock was in the Apoſtles tyme to belieue and obey them: who can doubt them but that as the Authority, iuriſdiction, and obligation of teaching deſcended to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, the infallibility alſo giuen to the Apoſtles for to acquit that obligation, did deſcend; it being giuen by God, for the loue and gouernment of the flock, that they should not be mis lead. And heere enters the argument that I propoſed in the former Chapter. Whoeuer does as Chriſt bids him do, and belieues as Chriſt bids him belieue, cannot do amiſs, nor belieue an errour; but Chriſt bids vs do and belieue, as the Church in ſucceeding ages bids vs do and belieue; therefore wee cannot do amiſs, nor belieue an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, conſequently they cannot mislead vs.</p>
               <p>But ſaies our Aduerſary, the Paraclet was to remayn with the Church vntill <hi>all truth</hi> was taught neceſſary for ſaluation; but it cannot be doubted but that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclet taught the Apoſtles all truth, and they deliuered thoſe Truths in their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word. Therefore after that word was
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41955:59"/>deliuered to vs, the Paraclet was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne no longer. This obiection well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, will giue light to our doctrin, and manifeſtly confirm its truth.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaies Io. 15.15. that he taught his Apoſtles all whateuer he had heard from his Father: it's manifeſt therefore he taught them all truths neceſſary for ſaluation: this was before his Paſſion, and yet after his Reſurrection, S. Luke c. 24. tells vs, that ie his iourny to <hi>Emaus</hi> with the two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he interpreted the paſſages of Scripture to them, which ſignifyes, that through inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertency or forgetfullneſs wee may come to doubt, euen of what truths were already taught: nay he ſaies Io. 16.12. that he had as yet, things to deeclare to them; and that the Holy ſpirit, when he came, would teach them all truth. Behold how Chriſt, hauing ſayd he taught all things, yet he ſayes, that he had many things to open to them, which they could not then learne, vntill the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clet came. This might ſeeme a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is none: for when he ſayd that he taught them all he had heard from his Father, that is to be vnderſtood, that he taught and deliuered to them the General Principles and Truths of Faith, wherin all truths of Religion were contained; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41955:59"/>what he had yet to ſay to them, were the conſequences, and particular Truths of Faith contained in thoſe general Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which the Paraclet would diſcloſe to them, its therfore that the Holy Ghoſt is called by the Fathers, Baſil. 5. cont. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom: and Mar. vict: 3. contra <hi>Arium,</hi> the <hi>Interpreter,</hi> and <hi>Voyce</hi> of the Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the interpreter ſayes nothing of his own, but deliuers in expreſſer terms, what the Author has already ſayd: and the text cleerly ſayes, the Paraclet taught nothing of the new, but what he had heard. <hi>Non enim loquetur à ſemetipſo, ſed quaecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que audierit loquetur:</hi> becauſe he did but expound in particular, what Chriſt had taught in general Principles, and opened to the Apoſtles the conſequences that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re contained in them.</p>
               <p>Now its manifeſt out of the text, that the Paraclet when he deſcended did not of a ſudain open to the Apoſtles all the Truths and conſequences included in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe General Principles deliuered by Chriſt; or if he did, that he did not ſo cleerly, as that they should haue vnderſtood all; for after that deſcent, wee read Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But wee do freely grant that the Apoſtles had at length a full and perfect knowledge of all truths of our Faith, and all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences included in thoſe general Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deliuered to them by Chriſt: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is no Truth of Faith which now is belieued by us, or shall be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by future Ages, but the Apoſtles did diſtinctly and particularly know; for as Tertul. ſayes, l. de praeſer. c. 22. <hi>quis inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grae mentis credcre poteſt, aliquid eos igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe, quos Magiſtros Dominus dedit: vvhat man of a ſound vvit, can belieue, that they vvere ignorant of any thing vvhom the Lord gaue vs for Maſters:</hi> wee confeſs alſo, that the Apoſtles did teach and deliuer all tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe truths to their diſciples either by their written word; or by word of Mouth to be handed to Poſterity by Tradition. whence S. Paul 2. Theſ. 2. commands, <hi>hold the Traditions vvhich ye haue learned, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Epiſtles, or by vvord of Mouth:<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſome of theſe truths, in ſucceding ages either through forgetfullneſs, or through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduertency of their Diſciples, and their ſucceſſors (who minded chiefly thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41955:60"/>that were oppoſed by Hereticks and laboured in declaring them, and neglected the others,) came to be only confuſedly knowen and not ſo exactly, as they were deliuered by the Apoſtles; and this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and has in all ages occaſioned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes in Religion.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Church in Cene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils declares an Article of Faith, it does not, as our Aduerſaryes calumny vs, coyn a new Article; it ads nothing to what the Apoſtles deliuered; but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to the Diſputants in Religion, what was antiently taught and belieued by the Apoſtles, and was forgotten or misvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by others. Doubts in Religion, are but Doubts of what the Apoſtles did teach, ſome ſay onething, others an other: what wee pretend is, that wheras theſe doubts haue been in all ages and euer will be; there has been, and euer will be an infallible Church to aſcertain vs, which is the true Doctrin; for though the Apoſtles knew all Truths, and taught them, either by <hi>vvord of Mouth,</hi> or in <hi>vvriting;</hi> what Doctrin they deliuered <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally,</hi> or by <hi>vvord of Mouth,</hi> is doubted of by Poſterity; if <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>That</hi> be of <hi>Apoſtolicall Tradition;</hi> alſoe the <hi>vvritten

Paul commands vs to hold faſt the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> receiued from them, whether by <hi>vvritten Epiſtles,</hi> or by <hi>ſpeech.</hi> 2. Theſ. 2. Now I ask were the Apoſtles infallible in the Points not <hi>fundamental</hi> and <hi>inferiour</hi> Truths that they taught, or not? if not, Scripture is not infallible in thoſe points, nor could S. Paul ſay when he preached points not <hi>fundamental,</hi> that <hi>their vvord vvas indeed the vvord not of men, but of God;</hi> for the word that is not infallibly true, is not Gods word. If they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, then the Church in the Apoſtles tyme was infallible in all points <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and not: either that Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not now extant, and ſo wee labour in vayn in pretending it is, or there is a Church now extant infallible in all doctrin of Religion <hi>fundamental</hi> and not; which can be ne other but the Roman Church, wheras Proteſtants and all other ſectaryes-owns themſelues to be fallible.</p>
               <p>You anſwer again, its the ſame Church as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> of a Church, which requires only to be infallible in <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> points, as yours is; but I will proue that it is as repugnant to the <hi>eſſence</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41955:63"/>of the true Church to be fallible or fals in ſmale articles of Faith as in great ones: I ſay in <hi>ſmale</hi> articles of Faith: for to teach a doctrin to be an article of Faith, is to teach it is reuealed by God: but it is impoſſible the true Church, should teach any doctrin ſmale or great to be a reuealed Truth, which is an vntruth, and not really reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God becauſe the Church is commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by God to teach vs <hi>his doctrin,</hi> what he has reuealed; and for that purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe has giuen her the Mark and Seale of his Commiſſion, which are Miracles, wherby to confirm their doctrin, by which God moues men to embrace and belieue the Church which teacheth. No proof more certain and ſtrong of the true Faith, Church, and Religion, than Miracles wrought in confirmation of it: when Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Ex. 4.1. ſaid, <hi>They vvill not belieue me, nor heare my voyce:</hi> God gaue him the gift of Miracles as a mark and ſign that he was ſent by him. When Elias rayſed the dead Child to lyfe (3. Reg. 17.24.) the Mother cryed out; <hi>novv in this I haue knovven, thou art a man of God, and the vvord of our Lord in they mouth is true.</hi> Chriſt being asked if he was the Meſſias, proued himſelf to be ſuch, by the Miracles he wrought, Mat.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41955:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>11.3. <hi>The blind ſee, the lame vvalk, the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are made cleane, the deafe heare, and the dead ryſe again.</hi> S. Paul 2. Cor. 12.12. calls the Miracles which he wrought, <hi>the ſigns of his Apoſtle ship,</hi> and S. Mar. laſt ch. ſaies that the Apoſtles preaching euery where wrought Miracles in confirmation of their doctrin. Chriſt to proue againſt the Scribes and Phariſees (Mat. 9.6.) that he had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of forgining ſins, which they denied, cured the ſick Man of the Palſie, <hi>That you may knovv that the ſon of Man hath povver of forgining ſins, ſaith he to the ſick of the Palſie, Aryſe, take up thy bed, and go to thy houſe.</hi> Therefore if the Catholik Church does work Miracles in proof of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin she teaches, tis an vnqueſtionable truth, that she is the true Church (as Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus concluded, Io. 3.2. <hi>No man could do thoſe things if God vvere not vvith him.</hi>) and that no man can deny or doubt her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin to be from God: wherefore Chriſt (Mat. 11.21. pronounced <hi>VVo</hi> againſt <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zain</hi> and <hi>Betſaida,</hi> becauſe they did not beliue his doctrin to be diuine, which they did ſee confirmed with ſo many Miracles you ſay they were no true Miracles, but Sorceries and Enchantments, or that the Authors were miſtaken in iudging them to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41955:64"/>be Miracles which were but Natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of natural cauſes. But I anſwer that nothing can be ſaid againſt thoſe Miracles wrought by the Profeſſors of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and related by S. Auguſtin, S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard and other Saints of the Church, which may not be alſo obiected againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of our B. Sauiour and Apoſtles. Could not the inhabitants of <hi>Corozain</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> ſay, that the Miracles which Chriſt alleadged, were but Sorceries, or effects of natural cauſes? did not the Scribs and Phariſees ſay it? to conclude, if thy were true Miracles, Tis euident the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin in whoſe confirmation they were wrought, is diuine; and all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, you will find, its rashneſs to deny that they were true Miracles, if you read carefully this Chap.</p>
               <p>Now it is impoſſible that God, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly <hi>True,</hi> and to whoſe infinit Veracity it is as repugnant to ſpeake a ſmale vntruth as a great one, should confirm any vntruth, euerſo ſmale, with a Miracle; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Church that would deliuer a mixt doctrin, of ſome great <hi>Truths,</hi> and ſome <hi>ſmale vntruths,</hi> it is impoſſible that God should work Miracles by that Church, in confirmation of her doctrin; for that would be to own that doctrin for his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41955:64"/>own, and owne ſmale vntruths to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed by him, wheras he giues his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and his ſeale and Marks of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for to teach them: And as it is not credible that the King of England should giue his commiſſion vnder the broad ſeale of England to any man to induce his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect into a Rebellion, ſo its leſs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God should giue his commiſſion. with his broad ſeale, which are Miracles and ſupernatural ſigns, to teach an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth euer ſo ſmale; his infinit veracity being ſo auerſe to all vntruth. By no other means did he confirm the doctrin of the Trinity to be his doctrin, by no other ſigns did he moue men to belieue, than by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Miracles by the Church that taught it; if therefore he works miracles by the Church that teachs <hi>Purgatory, real Prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> and others, which you call inferiour points and ſmale errours, he confirms that doctrin to be his, and ſo approues and ownes ſmale vntruths to be reuealed by him. Therefore S. Paul when he preached as well great, as inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Truths or articles, could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently ſay, that his words were indeed the words of God, becauſe God did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm his doctrin by Miracles and ſupernatural ſigns: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall auerring that the doctrin of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41955:65"/>and real Preſence are damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, if ignorance doth not excuſe the Profeſſors, certainly God would not giue the Marks of his Commiſſion (which are Miracles) to teach them. It remayns that wee proue, God has wroutght Miracles by the Roman Catholik Church, euen in thoſe ages, wherin the Proteſtants affirm that she was plung'd in errours; and in confirmation of thoſe Tenets, which they ſay are errors. Secondly that wee are bound to belieue them to haue been true Miracles; thirdly that the doctrin in whoſe confirmation they were wrought muſt be true reuealed doctrin.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, wee ſpeake not of forged Miracles, which haue been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the Church, and their Authors punisht as impoſtors; wee ſpeake of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled Miracles wrought in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the very Authors (and Authors of an vnſpotted credit, Holyneſs and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, euen in the opinion of our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) who relate them in their works left to Poſterity. S. Auguſtin l. 22. de Ciuit. Dei c. 8. relates, that in his own tyme, many miracles were wrought, and ſom in his own preſence, by the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the Church, by the <hi>interceſsion</hi> of Saints, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41955:65"/>their <hi>Relicks,</hi> eſpecially of ſaint Stephen, of ſaint Geruaſe and Protaſe, when (he being then in the towne) their Bodies were by a heauenly reuelation diſcouered to ſaint Ambroiſe at <hi>Milan:</hi> by the ſign of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> by the ſacrifice of <hi>Maſs,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> of Chriſt's ſepulcher; and mentions in particular (beſids others) that a woman called <hi>Palladia</hi> was ſudainly cured by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to S. Stephen, <hi>Ad ſanctum Martyrem orare perrexerat, quae mox vt cancellos attigit ſana ſurrexit.</hi> S. Bernard in ſaint Malachy's lyfe relates many Miracles wrought by this Saint; and that he himſelf, after the Saint expired, took his hand, and layd it vpon the withered and vſeleſs hand of a boy then preſent, who was preſently reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perfect health. The Miracles wrought by S. Bernard himſelf in confirmation of the Catholick doctrin of <hi>Tranſubſtantion</hi> and <hi>Inuocation of Saints,</hi> oppoſed in his tyme by the <hi>Henricians,</hi> and <hi>VValdenſes,</hi> are recorded by God fred in vita S.

No leſs authentick is that paſſage of <hi>S.

This Miracle was diuulged; <hi>Damaſcen</hi> call'd by <hi>Hiſiam;</hi> and after ſo ſupernatural a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Innocency, reſtored to his former dignities and Means; all which he renounced; gaue his Means to the Poore, and became a Prieſt, and a great Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Iconoclaſts. There is hardly any age of the Church but affords vs the lyke Miracles wrought by the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in confirmation of our Doctrin: it were tedions to rehearſe more, eſpecially when theſe now related are ſufficient for the preſent ſubiect.</p>
               <p>That theſe things happen'd (whither they were true Miracles or no, wee do not diſpute now) but that ſuch things as wee haue related, did really happen, no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man can deny it; for certainly he would be held for an obſtinat fool that would ſay, there was no ſuch man as Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar or Cicero in the world; that he neuer fought with Pompey; for which wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue no other warrant, but the teſtimony of Heathen Authors (for no Chriſtian did euer ſee them) and none but a mad man will deny but S.

Laſtly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctors do not deny but ſuch things did happen; but they ſay they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re no true Miracles: the Centuriſts, and Oſiander in Epit. cent. 9.10.11. pag. 213. <hi>the Miracles vvhich ſuperſtitious Monks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, are either feigned Miracles, or vvrought by Satans enchantments to eſtablish vvicked vvorship of Images, Inuocation of ſaints &amp;c. not that I think S.

               <p>Suppoſed then, that ſuch things did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happen, wee will proue they were, and wee are bonnd to belieue they were true Miracles: for this you cannot deny, but that S. <hi>Auguſt. S. Bern: Iohn Hieroſol.</hi> and <hi>God fred.</hi> who were wyſe learned, Holy D. Doctors did know what a Miracle was, as well as you: thoſe ſaints, and the ſaints of other ages were ey wittneſs of what paſs'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they examined narrowly the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and their circumſtances; thy iudged them to be true Miracles; muſt not wee belieue them to haue been ſuch, rather than your iugdment, who did not ſee the paſſages, nor was not born many hundred years after? and what is to be obſerued, that when <hi>Damaſcens</hi> hand was reſtored, and <hi>S. Bernard</hi> cured the ſick by the laoues he bleſſed; is it poſſible, if theſe had not been notorious miracles, but enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſom <hi>Iconoclaſt,</hi> and ſom <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician</hi> or <hi>vvaldenſes,</hi> againſt whoſe Doctrin they were wrought, should not haue exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſcouered the cheat? <hi>S.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41955:69"/>Courtiers; who enuyed his greatneſs, and preſſed <hi>Hiſiam</hi> to cut of his hand: and can it be imagined that none of all theſe should haue writ or published if that paſſage was a cheat and no knowen miracle? or by what means did the <hi>Centuriſts, Oſiander,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in our age, come to diſcouer they were all but enchantments, which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of thoſe Saints, that then liued, could not diſcouer? Once that <hi>Luther</hi> in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thought to cheat the world, and make men believe he could caſt out Deuils, the cheat was diſcouered and many wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that tyme did relate it. Once that <hi>Caluin</hi> in <hi>Geneua</hi> thought to delude the world, and shew that he could rayſe the dead, he bryb'd a man to feign himſelf dead, that he might be thought to rayſe him to lyfe; but the man was found dead in good earneſt, and the fourberie published by many writers. And thoſe Miracles rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Saints and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, had they been Sorceries and enchantments, is it poſſible that the Hereticks, againſt whoſe Doctrin they were wrought, or ſom one then liuing should not haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered it?</p>
               <p>This you cannot deny, but that <hi>Herod,</hi> and many Iews, who neuer did ſee our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41955:69"/>Sauiour work any Miracles, nor hear him preach, were bound to belieue, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat for not belieuing our Sauiors Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Doctrin; only vpon this account, that they were credibly informed by thoſe who were ey witneſs of his Miracles and doctrin; notwithſtanding that the <hi>Scrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid, they were wrought by the Deuil: wheras therefore S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the Saints of other ages, are as credible Witneſſes as thoſe Iews were that related the Miracles of Chriſts, and could iudge and know what a miracle was, as well as thoſe Iews, do inform you that thoſe true miracles were wrought in thoſe ages in confirmation of our Catholik Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and that, in their preſence; you are bound to belieue they were true miracles, and obſtinat in not belieuing them. To ſay, as the <hi>Centuriſts</hi> and <hi>Oſiander,</hi> that theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous works were Sorceries and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, is a moſt deſperat aſſertion; firſt it is to make the Saints and Fathers of antiquity (who relates them as wrought in their owne preſence, examined by them, and iudged to be true miracles) meer fools, that were deceiued, and knew not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish betwixt a true miracle, and a Sorcery: Secondly what rule or way hath
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41955:70"/>
                  <hi>Oſiander</hi> and the <hi>Centuriſts</hi> got, to know thoſe paſſages to be enchantments and not true miracles, which S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard</hi> and other Saints had not? Thirdly, Chriſt appayed the hungar of a multitude with few loaues which he bleſſed; S. Bernard cured the diſeaſes of a multitude by the loaues, which he bleſt: let vs abſtract from the Authors of theſe two actions; let the actions be conſidered by a learned Pagan Philoſopher, who belieues not in Chriſt; will not he iudge them both to be equally miraculous, or both to be but enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? I conclude what all wyſe learned holy men, (and eſpecially euen the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries alſo of the Author) do iudge, after an exact examin of all circumſtances, to be a true miracle; it is willfull obſtinacy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it be ſuch: but the fore named Saints, and they of all other ages (as will appeare if you read the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories) haue iudged miracles to be truly wrought in each age, ſom haue been eywitneſſes of miracles, other haue examined and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what they were, and their circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and iudged them to be ſuch: S. Iohn Damaſcen, and S. Bernards enemyes againſt whom they preached and writ, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to be ſuch. Therefore wee cannot
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41955:70"/>without obſtinacy deny them.</p>
               <p>Now, that wee are obliged to belieue the doctrin in whoſe confirmation they wee wrought, its proued by what is ſaid; and that if wee be not obliged to belieue Catholeciſme, its moſt apparent, wee are not obliged to belieue Chriſtianity; for by the ſelf ſame arguments by which you proue, againſt a Pagan, the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be true, wee alſo proue, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick to be true: conſequently either the Catholick muſt be true or the Chriſtian is not: by what were the Iews and Gentiles perſwaded, that Chriſtianity was reuealed by God? becauſe it was preached by Holy men, of great ſanctity of lyfe, of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, of no attache to the world or wordly things, of admirable virtue, and who confirmed their doctrin with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſigns and Miracles: but S. Bernard who preached the <hi>Inuocation of Saints, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> and veneration of <hi>Relicks,</hi> againſt the <hi>Henricians,</hi> was a great Saint; witneſs <hi>VVhitaker</hi> de Eccl. pag. 369. <hi>I do realy belieue S.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41955:71"/>Paſquils</hi> return into Engl. pag. 8. <hi>he vvas one of the lamps of Gods Church. S. Auguſtin</hi> was confeſſedly a great ſaint, S. <hi>Iohn Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi> that writ ſeueral learned Treatiſes againſt the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> for the worship of Images, S. <hi>Malachias,</hi> S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and S. <hi>Francis Xauerius,</hi> who conuerted ſo many Kingdoms in the Indies to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, at that very tyme, that Luther reuolted from the Church; all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and many more great Saints preached the Catholick Religion and confirmed it with many Miracles, as wee haue related and the Hiſtories do manifeſt: therefore wee haue as ſtrong motiues to perſuade the truth of Catholick Religion, as you haue to proue the truth of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; both therefore muſt be belieued, or neither.</p>
               <p>Can any man iudge it conſiſtent with the goodneſs of God, to permit <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> and the worship of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> if they were falſe doctrin, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to men, by great and Holy Saints, and confirmed by ſo many miracles; when by the very ſelf ſame means and motiues of credibility, he propoſes to vs Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; wherby men muſt find themſelues equally obliged to belieue both or neither?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41955:71"/>nor will it be an euaſion, to ſay that the Miracles wrought in fauor of Chriſtianity were true miracles, and thoſe which were wrought for Popery, were but enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſorceries; for abſtracting from Faith, which obliges vs to belieue that the miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were <hi>true</hi> miracles, our ſenſes and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon cannot but iudge the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Damaſcens hand, the healing of the ſick by the loaues bleſt by S. Bernard to be as true miracles, as any that was wrought by the Apoſtles; and therefore they were iudged by all wyſe men of thoſe ages to be ſuch: and abſtracting from Faith as I ſaid, what reaſon can be alleadged for to ſay, the one were true miracles, and the others not?</p>
               <p>I conclude with this diſcourſe: as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are obliged in conſcience to honor, their Parents, (its Gods commandment) ſo you are obliged in conſcience to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that Doctrin to be true, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by true Miracles: for as wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſcourſed, its impoſſible that God should confirm falſe Doctrin with true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that being repugnant to his infinit <hi>veracity,</hi> to confirm a lye with the ſeal, and marks of his Commiſſion to teach it: but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41955:72"/>for your obligation of honoring this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man and woman, who are your Parents; its not requiſit you haue euidence, and infallible aſſurance, that they are your Parents; its ſufficient for your obligation, that you are morally certain, they are yours; and this moral aſſurance which you haue, is grounded only vppon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of honeſt people that informs you of it: the lyke you haue, that true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles haue been wrought in many ages in confirmation of thoſe Tenets of ours, which you call erroneous; the teſtimony of great ſaints, as honeſt men as thoſe, who tell you that theſe are your Parents; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore you are obliged to belieue that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin is true, in whoſe confirmation thoſe Miracles were wrought.</p>
               <p>You reply; this makes our Faith of that doctrin but fallible Faith; for if I haue no more aſſurance of the truth of thoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, than I haue of the Miracles that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re wrought in confirmation of them; of the truth of thoſe Miracles, I only haue a moral aſſurance grounded vpon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and iudgment of thoſe ſaints which relate them; all which is but fallible; for it might happen they were deceiued; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the certainty I haue of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41955:72"/>truth of the Tenets, is but a moral and fallible certainty; and ſo our Faith is not infallibly true. I anſwer, the motiue of my Faith, and ground wher vpon it is bottom'd, is only the voyce of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Church, which deliuers that doctrin of God; which Motiue and ground is infallibily true. But becauſe this Motiue is obſcure, and does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare euidently and certainly to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that it does exiſt, the vnders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanding cannot aſſent vnto it, vntill it be made more knowen, and the way to make is more knowen, is not to make it euident that it <hi>exiſts;</hi> for the Motiue of Faith muſt be obſcure, and it is againſt the eſſence and nature of Faith, to be euident, or the Motiue of it to be euidently propoſed to the vnderſtanding, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Anderton does moſt ſolidly and learnedly demonſtrat in his Treatiſe of <hi>a ſoueraign remedy againſt Atheiſm and Hereſy:</hi> The way therefore of making it more knowen, is to make it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible, and lykely in the iudgment of any rational man, that ſuch a voyce of God ſpeaking by the Church, is extant: and this is don by the Miracles and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſigns, which the Church works in confirmation of her Doctrin; which are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41955:73"/>vndeniable inducements to any man of reaſon to iudge it moſt credible and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is God who ſpeaks by that Church: and our vnderſtanding being thus confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by this iudgment of credibility then follows our obligation of belieuing the Doctrin; the credibility of the exiſtence of Gods voyce by the Church, and our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of belieuing being thus propoſed by our vnderſtanding; The vnderſtanding is ſtill able to deny an aſſent to Gods voyce ſpeaking, becauſe nothing can force the vnderſtanding to an eſſent, but the euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the obiect; and its not euident to the vnderſtanding, that God ſpeakes, but <hi>euidently credible:</hi> therefore; the will muſt enter, which aſſiſted with the preuious iudgment of the credibility of the doctrin, and <hi>a pious inclination</hi> from God, for to reſolue, commands the vnderſtanding to aſſent to Gods voyce speaking, in which command of the will determining the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſting to Aſſent, the Merit of Faith doth conſiſt. So that the whole and only Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of our aſſent of Faith, is Gods voyce speaking by the Church: the Miracles and other ſupernatural ſigns, are not the Motiues of our Faith, but of our Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of credibility, and of our obligation
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41955:73"/>of belieuing a Doctrin ſo credibly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: which Iudgment of credibility and obligation of belieuing, need not to be abſolutly and Metaphiſically euident, but morally euident in the higheſt degree of Moral euidence, as it is in this caſe, that true Miracles haue been wrought in many, or moſt ages by the Catholick Church in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of her Tenets. Reade the <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Faith in the 2. part of thiſe Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Your obligation of belieuing the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Church being thus proued, your obligation of belieuing her infallible in all points of Doctrin, is moſt apparent: for God, whoſe veracity is infinit, cannot ſpeake the leaſt vntruth, nor deliuer it as his Doctrin, nor giue his commiſſion to teach it; nor confirm it with the markes and ſcale of his Commiſſion, for that would be to owne it te be his Doctrin reuealed by him; wheras therefore he has confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Doctrin of the Catholick Church with ſo many Miracles, its impoſſible it should contain the leaſt vntruth.</p>
               <p>And when you would be ſo obſtinat, as to doubt of all other Miracles, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo blind, as to doubt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of all Nations that euer were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Chriſtianity, by the Catolick
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41955:74"/>Church; what Nation was there euer yet conuerted to Chriſtianity by the Proteſtant Church? or in what Hiſtory do you read that euer you ſent Preachers to conuert Pagans? it was S. Auſtin, a <hi>Maſsing</hi> Prieſt ſent by Pope Gregory the Great, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted England to Chriſtianity; if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Chronicles of England: it was S. Xauerius a Ieſuit, (to whom Sectaries haue no relation, if you will not make him Father of the <hi>Quakers</hi>) that conuerted the Indies; it was S. Patrick ſent by Pope Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtin, that conuerted Ireland; they were Prieſt and fryars and Monks that propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ghoſpell, in whom Proteſtants haue no Intereſt, but what their reuolt from the Church has giuen them in their Lands and eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Miracles, what conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Nations to Chriſtianity, what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Paſtors, ſince Chriſt his tyme, what General Councils that condemned Hereſyes, can the Proteſtant Church shew? And is it poſſible, that God should haue giuen thoſe glorious Marks of a true Church, to the Catholick Church, if it were not the true Church; and giue no viſible Mark at all of a true Church to the Proteſtant, if it were the true one? both Churchs pretends to be the true, and ſereual other
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41955:74"/>Congregations pretends to the ſame: has God giuen no viſible marks wherby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh his true Church from fals ones? otherwyſe, why should wee be obliged to belieue <hi>This,</hi> to be the true Church, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>That</hi> other? and can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he should haue giuen Miracles and ſupernatural ſigns to the Catholick Church, if it were the falſe one, and giue none to any other, if any other were the true Church.</p>
               <p>Laſtly I proue that the Roman Catolick Church, is infallibly true in her Doctrin Purgatory, real Preſence, and any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin though smale and inferiour you call it. The Catholick Church as you confeſs, is infallible in fundamental points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, you ſay, (if you be a Proteſtant) that the Roman Church is ſtill a true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch becauſe it has not erred in the fundation or eſſential points of Faith. But if it did in any point whateuer, though ſmale you iudge it, it would etr in fundamental arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Religion: therefore it has not, nor cannot err in any whateuer: I proue the <hi>Minor.</hi> Its a fundamental article of Faith, that God is infinitly <hi>true,</hi> that he cannot tell an <hi>vntruth:</hi> but if the Doctrin of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory were untrue, the Catholick Church
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41955:75"/>would teach that God deliuers an vntruth; for the Church teacheth, that Purgatory is a Doctrin teuealed by God; if therefore Purgatory be an vntruth, she teachs that God deliuered an vntruth; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly she errs in a fundamental article of Faith.</p>
               <p>Now its tyme wee examin that impious Poſition of our new Miniſter, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall he follows much the tract of Luther his Grand Reformer, not in that he should haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with the Deuil as Luther did, in points of Religion, for the Deuil is not ſo kind but to the grand <hi>Hereſiarcks:</hi> thus far he imitats Luther that, in the beginning of his Apoſtacy, his chief drift was a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Catholick Church vpon any account whateuer; I ſay <hi>vvhateuer,</hi> for it is euident that the firſt Reformers had not fixed on any one ſettled Religion in opo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Catholick, wheras they were ſtrugling and diſputing for many years in ſeueral meetings, had to that purpoſe, to determin what ought to be belieued by all, and what articles of Popery ought to be denyed, and which not: which doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that their firſt drift was to ſeparat from the Catholick, and their ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour was to find out ſome other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41955:75"/>wee haue the proof of this in the Chronocles of England, for their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church of Rome began by the Schiſme of Henry the Eight, which was quite different from the Religion his ſucceſſor and Son Edwrad the 6. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to eſtablish; and this quite an other, from that which Queen Elizabeth introduced; for she would haue an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hierarchy, and other points de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by the former: that which the Queen eſtablished, was fashioned to an other shape by King Iames and his ſucceſſors. Nay to this day the Sectaries, who ſtyle them ſelues <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> do not agree, what Tenets muſt be held in opoſition to the Catholicks, but are ſufficiently Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by denying what the Catholick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues. Thus doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall proceed, for what he has propoſed to himſelf was a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, howeuer it should be, from the Church of Rome, but you will find in his diſcourſe that he is not yet throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, what Religion to chuſe and what to belieue; not only becauſe that he has reſolued to be of the Church of England which is an <hi>indiuiduum vagum</hi> ready to change with all gouernments, but that in his Declaration he profeſſes to belieue the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41955:76"/>39. Articles of the Church of England, and pag. 39. he ſayes, that the ſumme of his Faith is the written word of God and the plain vndubitable conſequences out of it and it is manifeſt that the 39. Articles are not plain vndubitable conſequences out of Gods written word: for, <hi>a plain vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable conſequence,</hi> is that, which, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes being granted, is iudged by all wiſe, learned, vnderſtanding men, to follow out of the Premiſſes, and cannot be denyed be any wyſe vnderſtanding man; That in the Roman Catholick Church there are wyſe, learned men, it were a madneſs to deny it; but a far greater madneſs to ſay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Doctors of all ages before thoſe 39. Articles were coyned, were not wyſe and learned men, that ſtudied and vnderſtood the Bible; and to all theſe the 39. Articles ſeems contrary to the word of God, ſo far they were, from iudging them <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>vndeniable conſequences</hi> out of it: And the Lutherans, Presbyterians, Anabaptiſts and Huguenots of France, do not allow the 39. Articles of the Church of England, and conſequently do not iudge them to be <hi>plain vndeniable conſequences out of Scripture.</hi> So that you muſt ſay, that either all are a company of knaues that ſpeake againſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41955:76"/>their conſciences, or that thoſe 39. Articles are not plain and vndeniable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of Scripture; conſequently M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls ſome tymes belieues only Scripture, and its plain conſequences; ſometyms more.</p>
               <p>But what proues that he is not yet throughly a Proteſtant (and ſo wee know not what he is, but a <hi>Not Catholick</hi>) is, his blaſphemous Poſition, <hi>that there is not ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the Roman Catholick Religion;</hi> for it is the conſtant doctrin of the Church of England that the Catholick Religion is a ſauing Religion: firſt, becauſe this has been euer yet their complaint againſt vs, that wee are vncharitable in denying ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Church, and they extol their own charity for granting that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Popery (prouided, he has no other ſin) a man may be ſaued. Secondly becauſe they confeſs, there was a true Church extant, the age that Luther began the Reformation, and all the precedent ages, for its an Article of our Creed, the conſtant Exiſtence of Gods Church, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Catholick Church;</hi> and that there was no other Church then extant, but the Roman Catholick Church, they alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, and muſt grant it; for the <hi>eſſence</hi> of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41955:77"/>the true Church conſiſting as they ſay, in the due adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and preaching of the word of God; and no other Church being extant in Luthers age, and the precedent, that adminiſtred Sacraments or preached the Ghoſpell but the Roman Church; doubtleſs it muſt haue been the true Church; for in what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Prouince, Citty, Village, Church or Chappell in the world was theſe things, or any of them, don by Proteſtants? its therefore the conſtant doctrin of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that Roman Catholick Church was then the true Church, and is now a true Church, for its the ſame now that then it was. Now, that a man may be ſaued in the true Church of God, prouided his lyfe be good, it were a blaſphemy to deny it; conſequently its a blaſphemy to ſay, that in the Roman Church a man may not be ſaued; and it were to ſay that all our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, for ſo many ages, all the Fathers Doctors and ſaints confeſſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants shem ſelues to be ſaints, were all damned.</p>
               <p>Neither can M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall excuſe his Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and cure the wound with that plaiſter of <hi>Ignorance</hi> which he applyes, ſaying that Papiſts (pag. 116.) may be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41955:77"/>by ignorance; and this ſmale comfort, he will not grant but to the <hi>ſimple ſort,</hi> and not at all to the learned men. So that none of our Anceſtors were ſaued for the ſpace of ſo many hundred years, no ſaints that are confeſſed by both Parties to be ſuch, if they were not fooles and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>ſimple ſort;</hi> wherby all the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and learned Fathers and Doctors of the precedent ages, and of this age are abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damned. Nay and <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> which he him ſelf ſtyles a <hi>ſaint,</hi> and none of the <hi>ſimple ſort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but a learned Doctor, who confeſſedly was a Papiſt is alſo damn'd. Its impoſſible that his Auditors, if they were of the Church of England, could heare him with patience, to caſt all their Anceſtors to hell; a Blaſphemy ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to the Doctrin of their Church; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein doth the Charity of the Proteſtant Church conſiſt, and they do vaunt that they exceed the Catholicks? is it in ſaying that by <hi>ignorance</hi> a Papiſt maybe ſaued in his Religion, prouided his lyfe be good? this is no exceſs of Charity, for wee grant alſo (as wee will declare in the enſueing Chap.) that Proteſtants, and not only they, but Heathens and Iews may be ſaued in their Religion, if they be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41955:78"/>and liue well. wee are but little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the Proteſtant charity, if they grant no greater capacity of ſaluation in the Roman Catholick Religion, then in Paganiſm and Iudaiſm. No S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſince you are reſolued to be a Proteſtant let me teach you their Doctrin; its thus: they ſay wee are guilty of errours, that their Tenets of <hi>figuratiue Preſence, No Purgatory &amp;c.</hi> are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable plain conſequences out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and therefore wee err in denying them: and that wee do err blamably and willfully, becauſe they are plain vndubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequences out of Scripture; (as you ſay alſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall (and wheras wee haue the ſcripture, and belieue it to be the word of God, and haue wits to vnderſtand, and ſufficient inſtruction, wee cannot but be willfully ignorant, which ignorance is not ſufficient to excuſe vs from blame for not belieuing: but they ſay, that our denying of them articles, though wee be obſtinat in our denyal, will not damn vs, (if wee haue no other ſin) becauſe they are not fundamental Articles of Faith; our errours do not shock the eſſential parts of religion, though it were better and more ſafe to belieue them, yet their belief is not abſolutly requiſit for ſaluation. This is the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41955:78"/>Doctrin of the Church of England; they grant vs ſaluation, not for any ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, but becauſe wee hold the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and all <hi>eſſential</hi> points of Faith.</p>
               <p>Its therefore that Bramhal, Bishop of Armagh, called the Articles wherin the Proteſtant diſſent from the Catholick Church, <hi>Pious opinions,</hi> and concluded that both Churchs had true Faith, its the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore that Doctor Stillingfleet compares both Churchs, the Catholick to a <hi>Leaky ship,</hi> wherin a man may be ſaued, but with great danger and difficulty; and the Proteſtant to a <hi>ſound ship,</hi> wherin one may be ſaued without hazard. Its therfore that King I ames in the meeting of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Clergy at Southampton pronounced this ſentence; <hi>vvee deteſt in this point the cruelty of the Puritans, and iudge them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of fire, vvho affirm that in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish religion a man may not be ſaued:</hi> reade the Doctors of your Church; Luther c. 6. and c. 4. in Gen.

               <p>Its true the Rigid Puritans, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots of france do ſay, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church did err in <hi>fundamental</hi> points of Faith neceſſary for ſaluation; and that therefore there is no ſaluation in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunion: and the Hugonots are of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, but ſince about the yeare 1634. for before, they conſtantly belieued with the Church of England, that the Catholick Faith was a ſauing Faith; witneſs the anſwer of the Hugonot Diuins to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>france,</hi> who asking if a man could be ſaued in the Roman Religion, they anſwered yea; wher vpon he pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently chooſed that Religion, which in the iudgment of all Parties was a ſauing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>Spondanus</hi> ad an 1593.

               <p>But I will proue againſt him and his Aſſociats Puritans, and Hugonots, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41955:79"/>there is ſaluation in our Religion, euen in their own Principles: for either the true Church can err in <hi>fundamental</hi> points, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiue of ſaluation, or not; if not, then the Roman Church, which in the confeſſion of you all, was the true Church, before, and in Luthers age, did not err in any point of doctrin repugnant to ſaluation; if it can, then your Church, though it should be, as you pretend, the true Church can err alſo in <hi>fundamental</hi> points: and you conſequently, cannot know if you be in the way of ſaluation. Secondly you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the Lutherans and Proteſtants are in a true way of ſaluation; but if the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Catholik Church were <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and <hi>damnable;</hi> They could not be in a ſure way of ſaluation; for it is as dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable an errour, to ſay that a man may be ſaued in the profeſſion of damnable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; as to profeſs them: for example its as damnable an errour to ſay, that a man may be ſaued denying Ieſus-Chriſt, as it is to deny him; <hi>vae qui dicitis bonum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum;</hi> if the Catholicks therefore be in a damnable ſtate for profeſſing thoſe, which you call errours; the Proteſtants and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans; who vnanimously ſay, they can be ſaued in the actual profeſſion of thoſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41955:80"/>errours, muſt be in a damnable ſtate. You muſt then either abſolue both, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn both: beſids, the Lutherans hold ſome Points with the Catholicks, which you condemn as damnable errors in our Religion, for example, the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſts Body in the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> yet you belieue the Lutherans may be ſaued in their Religion; therefore you muſt grant ſaluation to the Catholicks.</p>
               <p>And now let vs draw M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall by the skirt, and mind him of what he ſayes pag. 24. The Arch.

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:41955:80"/>wherin doth the <hi>Honor</hi> of that Title of <hi>Catholick</hi> conſiſt, if it does not ſignify a Profeſſion leading to ſaluation? is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that wee belieue many articles of Chriſtianity, though wee deny ſome? then the Title of <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> is <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;</hi> which Profeſſions belieued diuers Tenets of Chriſtianity.

I ſay where was it when Luther began his pretended Reformation? for then there was no viſible Congregation of Chriſtians (at leaſt No Proteſtants nor any thing lyke them) that did adminiſter Sacraments and preach the word of God, but was vnited in Faith and Communion with the Roman Church; only ſuch as were then held by Luther, and now by vs ſchiſmatick as you are: which then, was the other part of Chriſt's true Church? but this is not all; how could he ſay, and you belieue, that the Roman Church, (take it either for the Dioces of Rome, or as wee vnderſtand it,) is a part of the Catholick Church, if it be guilty of damnable errors? can that be the true Church, or any part of it, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes damnable errors againſt Faith? S. Athanaſius his Creed ſayes, no: for it: requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41955:81"/>to haue an entyre and inuiolable Faith: and you that is a Profeſſor of Diuinity, will ſay, that a particular Perſon who holds damnable errors againſt the doctrin of the Church and obſtinatly adheres to them, is an heretick, and no member of hers: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently you muſt ſay, (and your Inſtructor deluded you in ſaying the contrary) that the Roman Church can be not part of the true Church, if in her there was no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uationthrough damnable errors in doctrin.</p>
               <p>You ſee M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall that againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the Church of England, againſt your own and your Inſtructors conceſſions, you haue engaged in that blaſphemous aſſertion of not ſaluation in the Catholick Church, to vſe your own expreſſion, pag. 75. <hi>to ſpight the Catholick you ran beyond all meaſure, euen of your ovvn principles; as to ſpight the Ievv, and ſeem a good Chriſtian, one vvould eat more Pork, than his ſtomak can beare.</hi> And to get the credit of a ſound and zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant among your new Brethren, you haue exceeded them in decrying the Church.</p>

               <head>VIII. CHAPT. <hi>THAT THE PROTESTANT CHVRCH is not the Church of Chriſt, nor any part of it: That they cannot vvithout blaſphemy alleadge Scripture for their Tenets: That they haue not one, and the ſame Faith vvith Catholicks: that out of the Catholick Church there is no ſaluation. Hovv far can ignorance excuſe Proteſtants.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is the conſtant doctrin of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church (for I call not the <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Hugonots</hi> of France, Proteſtants, whoſe error in this point I haue she wen in the former chap.) that the Catholick Church has not erred in <hi>fundamental</hi> points of Religion; becauſe the true Church, (ſuch as the Catholick was before Luther confeſſedly, and now is, in their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment) cannot err in <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> articles, conſequently they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the Proteſtant and Catholick Church, differ only in points not <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> and inferior truths, which, ſay
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41955:82"/>they, are pernicious errors, but break not Vnity of Faith, nor deſtroyes not ſaluation. That the true Church can err, and is falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in points <hi>not fundamental</hi> and <hi>inferior truths.</hi> This is faithfully the doctrin of the Proteſtant Church, as you will find in the Authors I quoted in the former Chapt. in Stilling fleet in his book miſcalled a <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Account</hi> and in ſeueral others cited in the Proteſtant Apology, tr. 1. c. 6. and tract. 2. c. 2.</p>
               <p>Now wee muſt conſider, what is the Proteſtant Church properly; it belieues many Articles (and as they ſay all <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Articles) that the Catholick belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: ſo far they are not Properly Proteſtants, but their proper Notion is to be taken from thoſe Tenets, wherin they differ: ſo that <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> properly, and as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct from <hi>Catholeciſm,</hi> or <hi>Popery,</hi> as you ſay; is the doctrin wherin the Proteſtant Church differs from the Catholick. Now I proue that the Proteſtant Church, as it is properly the Proteſtant Church, condiſtinct from the Catholick, is not the Church of Chriſt; becauſe it does not teach the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of Chriſt; and no Church can be called of Chriſt further that it teacheth his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin; and doubteleſs if wee did ask the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:41955:83"/>Proteſtants and firſt Reformers, why they did ſeparate from the Catholick Church, they would ſay. <hi>To belieue and practiſe the Doctrin of Chriſt, vvhich the Catholick denyed.</hi> But I will proue that their doctrin, for which they ſeparated from vs, and wherin they differ from vs, is not the Doctrin of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The argument is in <hi>Ferio,</hi> thus: <hi>No fallible doctrin is the doctrin of Chriſt.</hi> For who would be ſo blaſphemous, as to ſay, that what Chriſt has taught is fallible Doctrin: <hi>But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy</hi> (thats to ſay all the Doctrin wherin Proteſtants differr from Catholicks and for which they ſeparated from vs) <hi>is altogether fallible Doctrin; therefore Proteſtancy, as it is properly the Doctrin of the Proteſtant Church, is not the Doctrin of Chriſt:</hi> That <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> or the Doctrin wherin wee differ, is all falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrin, its manifeſt; for <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> or Doctrin wherin wee differ, is altogether of points not <hi>fundamental;</hi> wee all agree in the <hi>fundamental</hi> Articles, as they vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously confeſs; wee only differ in <hi>inferiour Truths,</hi> wherin the Catholick Church has erred. But the doctrin of points not <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and <hi>inferior truths</hi> is fallible Doctrin; for its their conſtant Doctrin alſo, that the true Church, be it the Catholick or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41955:83"/>can err and is fallible in articles not <hi>fundamental,</hi> and <hi>inferiour truths:</hi> therefore all your <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> is but fallible doctrin; therefore its not the doctrin of Chriſt. I confeſs ingenuously, I think this argument cannot be ſolidly anſwered.</p>
               <p>For is it not certain, that you differ from vs, as you ſay, only in <hi>not fundamental</hi> arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? is it not alſo your doctrin, that the true Church is fallible in articles not <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental;</hi> how can it then be denyed, but; that you differ from vs only in fallible doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin; the doctrin wherin you differ from vs is Proteſtancy, and nothing els is properly Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, but that for which you departed from vs: therfore your Proteſtancy is but fallible doctrin, and conſequently not the doctrin of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Hence I infer that you cannot without Blaſphemy looke for your doctrin in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; no text or word of God can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for Proteſtancy; nor any other warrant but your meer fancy: for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy is but a parcell of fallible doctrin, and no fallible doctrin can without Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be ſought for in Scripture, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing but Gods infallible word. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue how vainly the Proteſtants do boaſt their Religion, and differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from vs to be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41955:84"/>bottom'd on the word of God; that their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue Preſence, is cleer in the Scripture that they will proue the pretended errors for which they forſook vs, by Scripture: they amuſe the poore People with the ſpecious pretext of Scripture; no Rule of Faith but Scripture; no Iudge of Controuerſy, but Scripture; no warrant for Diuin wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but Scripture, and after all, its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by my former diſcourſe, that no Article of Proteſtancy, as it is a particular Doctrin diſtinct from Catholeciſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout ſacrilege be sought for in Scripture.</p>
               <p>If the Proteſtant Church be not <hi>The</hi> Church of Chriſt, it can be no part of it, for the ſame reaſon which, but now, I propoſed, for that no Article of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is the Doctrin of Chriſt, being all but fallible Doctrin; if they will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be a part of the Church becauſe they belieue the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, wherin they agree with vs; and thats ridiculous, becauſe, in ſo much they are not Proteſtants; its not for them Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that they departed from vs, and ſet vp a diſtinct Church, this is to be a part of the Church in as much as they can pretend to be of the Roman Catholick Church: and if they might be called a part of the Church
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41955:84"/>for that reaſon; Pelagians, Eutychians, and other Heretick Congregations may be called ſo alſo, and thus the Church of Chriſt inſteed of being the Houſe of Peace and vnion, be a houſe of confuſion.</p>
               <p>Out of this diſcourſe alſo wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how vain is the pretence of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and ſeueral other ſects, to vnity of Faith with the Roman Catholicks; for when wee vrge them with this argument; There is but <hi>One Faith,</hi> as there is <hi>but one God</hi> S. Paul Eph. 4. without that <hi>one Faith, its impoſsible to pleaſe God;</hi> the Catholick Church has that Faith, for you ackowledg its a true and a ſauing Faith, that holds all Articles neceſſary for ſaluation; if therefore there be but one ſauing Faith no other will ſaue but the Roman Catholick Faith: they are ſo grauel'd with this diſcourſe that they are glad to claim kinred with vs, and ſay that wee all, <hi>Catholicks, Lutherans Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterians</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> haue but one and the ſame Faith, as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials</hi> of Faith; becauſe wee all belieue the Prime and chief Articles of Chliſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Chriſts Incarnation, Paſſion, &amp;c. which with a good moral lyfe is ſufficient for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; nor is it poſſible that God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a man that belieues thoſe Articles,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41955:85"/>and liues a good lyfe, for denying Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a tryfle nothing material if there be any or not. This <hi>Omnifidian</hi> Doctrin of the <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarians</hi> is now in great vogue, and cryed vp for a charitable Doctrin that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes none from ſaluation, but lycenceth you to change Religions as your Intereſt or conuemency requires.</p>
               <p>Out of this Principle follows, that if they haue not the ſame Faith with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, they haue not a ſauing Faith; otherwiſe there would be two ſauing Faiths: But they are not of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Faith, nay they are of a far different; for its not enough for <hi>vnity</hi> of Faith with the Catholicks, to belieue the <hi>Prime fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> Articles; but all and euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Article, though inconſiderable it may ſeeme to you, which the Catholick Church propoſes to be a reuealed truth: any one Article that you deny, though ſmale it be, for example <hi>Purgatory,</hi> breaks <hi>vnity</hi> of Faith with the Roman Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>The Church belieues the Real preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and belieues the Lawfullneſs of Marriage; and the lawfullneſs of eating any victuals. You cannot iuſtly ſay, that one of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is more. <hi>Fundamental</hi> than the other:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41955:85"/>why should the Lawfullneſs of Marriage be a <hi>Fundamental</hi> point of Religion, more than the <hi>real Preſence?</hi> by your ſence of <hi>Fundamental</hi> and <hi>not fundamental</hi> Articles, they are of a ſeyſe. And what think you? would he that agreeth in all other Articles and deny only the Lawfullneſs of Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, would he, I ſay, haue <hi>vnity</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> with the Catholick Church? by your rule he would, becauſe he agrees in all <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> and <hi>Prime</hi> points; he only differs in an inferior truth, a ſmale matter. Yet S. Paul expresly ſayes that he would not: 1. Tim. 4.3. <hi>in the lather dayes certain vvill depart from the Faith</hi> (obſerue the word <hi>depart) attending to the Spirit of errors and Doctrin of Deuils, for bidding to Marry and abſtain from meats.</hi> Doth not this proue that the denyal of ſmale Articles breaks <hi>vnity</hi> of Faith? you cannot therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to haue the ſame Faith with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, that deny many Articles of their Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly the reſurrection of the flesh is indeed a <hi>fundamental</hi> Article, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Apoſtles Creed; but if it be to come at the end of the world, or already paſt, to ſuch as are dead; each ſoule after mans death reaſſuming again his body in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41955:86"/>a short tyme, as <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> ſaid, its no <hi>fundamental</hi> Article, as you Proteſtants vnderſtand <hi>fundamentals,</hi> for the chief and prime Articles: yet S. Paul ſayes of theſe two 2. Tim. 2.18. <hi>their ſpeech ſpreadeth lyke Canker, of vvhom is Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus and Philetus vvho haue erred from the truth, ſaying that the Reſurrection is paſt, and haue ſubuerted the Faith of ſome.</hi> Behold the denyal of ſmale and inferiour truths, is called by S. Paul, a <hi>ſpreading canker, an erring from the truth,</hi> a <hi>ſubuerſion of the Faith;</hi> it breaks therefore vnity of Faith; and hence conclude, that you haue not vnity of Faith with the Roman Church, though you belieue with her the Trinity, Incarnation and other chief Articles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you deny many others, vnder the pretence of being ſmale and inferour Truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deceiue not your ſelf with that diſtinction of fundamental and not fundamental Articles, wher with your Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do amuſe you. No article whateuer is man obliged to belieue, if it be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to him that God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed it: and any article whateuer, which is ſufficiently propoſed vnto vs, to haue been reuealed by God; wee are obliged vnder pain of damnation to belieue: it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41955:86"/>ſo that as to our obligation of belieuing, all Articles are equally fundamental, if they be ſufficiently propoſed. Its true ſom Myſteries of Faith are of their own Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re more requiſit, and needfull, and on that account may be called <hi>fundamental,</hi> as the Myſtery of the Trinity, and Chriſt his Incarnation; but that is nothing to our purpoſe, what obliges me to belieue them, is not that they are ſo abſolutly or greatly needfull, for no ſuch abſolut nor great neceſſity of Chriſt his <hi>death</hi> can be proued, he could haue redeemed vs with one tear he shed; yet it is a <hi>fundamental</hi> Article, becauſe it is ſufficiently propoſed to me, to be a truth reuealed: ſo that in order to my obligation of belieuing, all Articles ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propoſed, as reuealed truths, are equally fundamental: And ſince that wee own our obligation of belieuing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be Scripture, Trinity and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, vpon the teſtimony of the Church which ſayes they are reuealed Truths, ſince the ſame Church declares that Purgatory alſo is a reuealed Truth, I am as much obliged to belieue it, as the Trinity and Incarnation, though the Myſteries in them ſelues, be of an infinit inequality.</p>
               <p>By this its proued that without the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41955:87"/>belief of all and euery Article belieued by the Church of Rome, you haue not one and the ſame Faith with her; if you haue not her Faith, you haue not the true ſauing Faith; for hers is ſuch, and there is, but <hi>One:</hi> if you haue not a true ſauing Faith, you cannot be ſaued: therefore out of the Church of Rome there is no ſaluation. Blame me not for this Aſſertion; blame S. Paul who ſaies there is no ſaluation wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout Faith, and ſaies there is but one Faith, which wee haue proued, and you confeſs to be our Faith: blame S. Auguſtin epiſt. 152. <hi>VVhoeuer is, or shall be ſeparated from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, although he thinks himſelf to liue moſt laudibly, for this one vvickedneſs, that he is disioyned from the vnity of Chriſt, shall haue no lyfe, but the vvrath of God remayns on him;</hi> blame the Fathers of all ages, who vnanimously agree in this; that out of the true Church there is no ſaluation. By what I haue diſcourſed in the firſt chap. it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there is but one Church: by what I haue diſcourſed in the progreſs of this Treatiſe and eſpecially in theſe two laſt chap. I proued that this one true Church is the Roman Catholick Church. Its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent therefore that out of her Faith and communion is no ſaluation.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41955:87"/>
               <p>Neither can wee be iuſtly accuſed of want of charity for holding this Tenet: by your acknowledgment (I mean the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Lutherans) the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a ſauing Religion: but no Religion is a ſauing Religion, that is not charitable, witneſs S. Paul 1. Cor. 13.2. <hi>If I should haue Faith, ſo as to moue mountains, and haue no Charity, I am nothing.</hi> Therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, but our Faith is a charitable Faith.</p>
               <p>Anſwer me to this argument; God has commanded vnder the dreadfull punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of being blotted out of the book of lyfe, to add nothing to, or diminish any thing from his word: Reuel 22.19. and Deut. 4.2. Either wee Catholicks do add to the ſubſtance and eſſentials of the Faith of Chriſt, by belieuing <hi>real Preſence,</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> to be <hi>fundamental</hi> points of Religion reuealed by God, or you Proteſtants do diminish from the ſubſtance and eſſence of his Faith by denying thoſe points, and ſaying they are not ſubſtantial and eſſential points of Religion: either then, wee Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks muſt be blotted out of the Book of lyfe, becauſe wee belieue too much, and impoſe vpon the flock a larger belief than Chriſt has; or you Proteſtants muſt be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41955:88"/>out of that book, becauſe you take away ſome <hi>fundamental</hi> points which Chriſt has reuealed: it is therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that in both Religions a man be ſaued. Either wee are not a ſauing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe wee add <hi>fundamental</hi> points; or you are not, becauſe you take them away, But by your acknowledgment, and by what wee haue proued wee are in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Religion; therefore you muſt confeſs that you are not.</p>
               <p>Now wee muſt examin if ignorance can excuſe the Proteſtants, they pretend that they do not know they are in an error; ad heer wee will anſwer to what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall auers, that all Catholick Doctors confeſs, that a Proteſtant baptized, belieuing the Common Principles of Chriſtianity, not conuinced of error againſt Faith, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing he follows the truth; is not an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, but a member, of the Catholick Church; and ſo liuing a good lyfe may be ſaued; for which he cites our Catholick Diuins.</p>
               <p>It is the conſtant Doctrin of our ſchools, that an inuincible ignorance of the Truth excuſeth from the profeſſion of it: and ſaying that it is the conſtant Doctrin, I need not cite Authors for it. An inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41955:88"/>ignorance, is when you haue no means, nor cannot get, after a diligent enquiry, any means, for to ouercome it, and be informed of the Truth. The ſecond po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition aſſented alſo vnto by our ſchools, that a vincible, ſupin, or groſs ignorance doth not excuſe you, from profeſſing the Truth: and this kind of ignorance you are in, when you haue means afforded to you, for to inſtruct you, and through careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſome other motiue, you do not make vſe of thoſe means: or if you haue not thoſe means at hand; you may, if you enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re for them get them and be inſtructed; and in ſo weighty a matter as Chriſtian Faith wherof depends your ſaluation; did you know that in Conſtantinople you could find them, you ought, ſetting all other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations aſyde, to go thither to ſeek them. Now wee all grant, that a Proteſtant who is inuincibly ignorant, that has no way, nor after due enquiry, can get no means to ouercom his ignorance, and be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently informed of the truth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Tenet; ſuch a man Baptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the common Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and liuing a good lyfe will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but this is ſmale comfort, for of the Iews and Pagans wee muſt ſay the lyke.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41955:89"/>Secondly a Proteſtant (and there are I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, many of this ſort) that would amuſe himſelf with the perſwaſion of being in an inuincible ignorance, and that his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets will not condemn him, becauſe, if in effect they should be falſe he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that, and his ignorance, which he perſwads himſelf to be inuincible, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, and will not be curious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any more; this man, I auerr is in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of damnation; for its a damnable ſin to expoſe himſelf to a manifeſt danger of profeſſing a damnable error, but this man who perſwades himſelf that he is <hi>inuincibly</hi> ignorant, and ſooths himſelf with that perſwaſion, and ſo reſteth content, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelf manifeſtly to the danger of holding a damnable error: for what he has to ſecure him, is only an <hi>inuincible</hi> ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and what if that ignorance be not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>inuincible?</hi> what if he be not certain, that his ignorance is <hi>inuincible?</hi> then it cannot excuſe him: therefore wheras he does not certainly know that his ignorance is <hi>inuincible,</hi> he expoſes himſelf to manifeſt danger of profeſſing a damnable error.</p>
               <p>But howeuer the Principle taken in itſelf is true; that if a Proteſtant be <hi>inuincibly</hi> ignorant, it excuſes him. And wheras no
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41955:89"/>man can certainly know that the ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of a Proteſtant it not inuincible;, (only God can know that) certainly it is rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any man to ſay; <hi>this man that dyed in the Proteſtant Religion is damned.</hi> For <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible</hi> ignorance is a matter of fact; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, of, that the truth was not ſufficiently propoſed; that the means apointed by God for our inſtruction were not had, or could not be had; and how can you know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all Proteſtants haue the truth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to them or that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, or can haue the ſufficient means to be inſtructed in the truth; nay or to doubt in the leaſt of their own Profeſſion: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a yong Lad that neuer left his Fathers houſe; neuer heard of Catholick Religion but all to deſaduantage; has no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to confer, with, or if any, not ſuch as can giue him ſatisfaction; he is through ſickneſs or other impediments vnable to go in ſearch of Prieſts, or learned men; he liues in his own Profeſſion well: can you be ſure that this Lads ignorance was not inuincible? for my part, I iudge there are ſom though but few I feare, that haue an inuincible ignorance. I ſay but few, for the reaſon I will produce ſoon. But of learned men and men vers'd in the tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41955:90"/>of ages, wee may haue moral aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that their ignorance cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible; and of them we may ſay, that if God has not giuen them ſom inward light in the laſt gasp, and an act of contrition, (which yet to vs is vn knowen) but that they dyed in the belief of their Tenets they are damn'd.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why I ſay, that but few Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants can haue an inuincible ignorance of our Catholick Doctrin, is; All men are perſwaded that there is a true Church, and there is nothing more euident to any man of common ſenſe, than that all thoſe Congregations, and each of them which wee ſee among vs of <hi>Quakers, Presbyterians Anabaptiſts, Proteſtants, Catholiks,</hi> are not the true Church, this I ſay is apparent to any man of common ſenſe; becauſe each of vs condemns not only the external go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but the Tenets of the other; and though all the reſt ioyns to oppoſe the Catholick, yet take them ſeperatly, they are as appoſit againſt one an other, as they are againſt vs. In this confuſion there is a very eaſy way to find out which of all is the true Church; for what is more eaſy for a man that reflects ſeriously vpon the concerns of Religion, (which euery man
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41955:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>is obliged in conſcience to do) than to learn by the Chronicles of England, and by the ſeueral Hiſtoryes that are written, when did theſe that wee call <hi>Reformations</hi> begin; on what occaſion, and where in the world was there any ſuch thing as <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church, <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church &amp;c. two hundred and four years agon. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is not a child in the Parish hardly, but knows that Luther and Caluin began the Reformation which now is called <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Presbyterian</hi> &amp;c. in oppoſition to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, which was, as they pretended full of errors; then Maſs was banished, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Monks and Prieſts were exiled, and their Lands forfeited, the Churches were taken from vs; and the Reformation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. I know the Proteſtant will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thath his Religion is <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> that it was the very Religion which Chriſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and the Apoſtles preached, but this conſideration is too heigh for men of common vnderſtanding, this point can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſoon cleered; therefore I will not now engage in it, becauſe I pretend to shew to men of common vnderſtanding an eaſy way to find out, if this or that be a true Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether your Religion was in the Apoſtles tyme or no; you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41955:91"/>but that which you call the <hi>Reformation,</hi> is but of leſs than two hundred years date. The ruins of the Churchs and Abbyes, the Church Lands, the Croſſes placed in the heigh way, and ſeueral other marks yet extant of Popery do teſtify it was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, that was the Religion of the Land, your Chronicles beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it was it that florished for ſo many ages before, in it your Anceſtors did liue and dye. This no man but knows.</p>
               <p>This ſuppoſed; there is no man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe (if he reflects on the affairs of his ſaluation, which reflexion wee are all obliged to make) but is obliged to doubt of this Reformation, or any branch of it be the true Religion; you ſay men of common ſenſe, and of good vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding do not doubt of it, notwithſtanding all what wee haue premiſſed; but I ſay that they are obliged in conſcience to doubt of it, if they do not its through a ſupin and groſs negligence of their ſaluation, which is culpable and damnable. I ſay they are bound in conſcience to doubt of it: firſt becauſe common ſenſe, if not byaſs'd by ſom preiudice, does dictat to any man, that nouelties and innouations in matters of Religion are to be ſuſpected, and this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41955:91"/>pretended Reformation is ſuch, that was vn knowen to the world the day that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began it, and to all the precedent ages; for neuer was there any ſuch thing as Proteſtancy ſpoken of. Secondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe common ſenſe dictats to a man that an ancient Religion, which florished, and which, and noe other was eſtablished in all Chriſtiandom ought not to be reuerſed by a priuat Man as Luther was, without sheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Miracles and ſupernatural ſigns, that he was commiſſioned by God for ſo great a work; and wheras Luther did shew no ſuch (no Proteſtant dare ſay that euer he did) the truth of his Reformation ought to be doubted of. Thirdly that very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church which he oppoſed, was in former ages often oppoſed by others, and she ſtill remayned victorious, and her oppoſers condemned for Hereticks, which to any rational man is a ſufficient ground for to doubt, that Luther alſo might be ſuch as the other oppoſers were.</p>
               <p>And if you ſay that you ought not to doubt becauſe your Anceſtors haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently examined the cauſes of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and found them to be iuſt; and that you receiue the Faith you profeſs from them; and that you rely on their word: I anſwer, for one Anceſtor of yours who
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41955:92"/>approued the Reformation; a hundred of your Anceſtors approued the old Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, without any ſuch Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And were there no other cauſe for any man of common ſenſe for to doubt of the truth of the Reformation, than that the very Reformers and their reſpectiue ſucceſſors are deuided among themſelues, ſome of them approuing in the Catholick Church for good Doctrin, what others condemn for an error; this very diſſention ought to make the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſuſpected. For Caluin and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which are the Church of England (in ſo much) condemns the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt his Body in the <hi>Euchartſt;</hi> Luther and his Diſciples do firmly belieue the <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> Luther condemns the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church for belieuing S. Pauls Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrevvs,</hi> and ſome other parts of Scripture, to be Canonical: Caluin, with the Church of England ſays the Catholicks do well, and they alſo belieue them to be Canonical. Seueral other examples wee could bring of Doctrins that ſome of the Reformers condemn for errors in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and other Reformers ſay they are no ſuch: ought not this to make vs doubt of the truth of this Reformation.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:41955:92"/>
               <p>Now that it is apparent, that any man man of common ſenſe who reflects on Religion ought to doubt of this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; the way to ſatisfy his doubt is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy. For if he finds that the Catholick Church does in this age, and in Luthers, and each of the precedent ages work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in confirmation of her Doctrin; and that the Reformation, nor any branch of it, has none; can any reaſonable man deſire a more pregnant proof of the truth of the Catholick Church, and falshood of the Reformation? reade the Hiſtoryes, and Fathers of all ages, you shall find the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by her, as I related in the former Chapter; you ſay you find them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but you do not belieue them: this I call, and cannot be called otherwyſe than obſtinacy; to deny what the whole Torrent of Antiquity affirms, as it would be obſtinacy to deny there was a Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar in the world, for which wee haue but the teſtimony of Hiſtoryes written by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, for no Chriſtian did ſee him. You ſay the Authors that relate thoſe Miracles were Papiſts and therefore their teſtimony to be ſuſpected. I anſwer the Authors who write thoſe Miracles had no pike againſt Proteſtants, nor did not write out
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41955:93"/>of any deſign againſt you, for you were not in the world, and therefore, you ought not to pretend any exception againſt them: and if but one or two did relate them, your reflexion could be pardonable; but to ſay that all the Fathers and Hiſtorians of Antiquity, were knaues that ſpoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their conſciences (many relating them to haue been wrought in their own preſence) or fools that did not vnderſtand what miracles were, is an intolerable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence.</p>
               <p>Add to the Miracles wrought by this Church in all ages, the conuerſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Chriſtianity, (and none by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) the ſucceſſion of her Bishops without interruption for ſo many ages; (no ſuch in the Reformation) Her Eminent Saints, (none in the Reformation) her vnion in Doctrin of Faith; (none in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the voluntary pouerty of her Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, exchanging plentifull eſtates for the powerty of a religious lyfe (a practiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Chriſt, and thought mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Reformation) the multitude of Churchs built by her, and demolished by the Reformation. Does not all this proue our Church to be the true Church of Chriſt, that he has qualified with ſuch
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41955:93"/>glorious Marks. Theſe makes our Church ſo glorious, and shyne lyke the Citty on the Mountain, lyke the candle in the cand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtick, that it is hardly poſſible that any man can haue on inuincible ignorance of her being the true Church; and <hi>VVo</hi> be to the man, that relying on the perſwaſion of the inuincibility of his ignorance (which in effect is but obſtinacy) will liue out of her.</p>
               <p>I conclude with that Paper, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall ſpeakes of, wherin he deliuered that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, belieuing the common Principles of Chriſtianity, and lieuing acording the rules of his profeſſion, being inuincibly ignorant might be ſaued; for which doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin he complains to haue been cenſured; and cryes <hi>Victory,</hi> becauſe that none of our Clergy did anſwer, though they did cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him. He misinforms his Readers; it was not that doctrin which was cenſured, and if his Paper did contain no more than it; it required no anſwer; it was his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion was cenſured: and I will be iudged by you, Reader, if he was not indiſcreet in this point: for if a Preacher were ſent to conuert Pagans to Chriſtianity, would it be diſcretion in him to teach them, Srs <hi>the Chriſtian Religion is the beſt, but you may be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41955:94"/>very vvell ſaued in that vvhich you hold, if you be inuincibly ignorant.</hi> The doctrin is very true, but a man that goes to conuert them, to Chriſtianity from a Religion that he knows is in itſelf falſe, ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to remayn in that Religion, with the hopes of being ſauedin it: his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is to beat them out of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and not to propoſe it vnto them, as a <hi>Medium</hi> of ſaluation: would not they anſwer him well; if wee can be ſaued through our ignorance in the Religion wee haue; why do you diſturb vs with any other, and creat ſcruples in our minds? This is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls caſe that was ſent to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to conuert Proteſtants who thought themſelues perhaps to be inuincibly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: iudge you was it diſcretion to propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vnto them their inuincible ignorance as an encouragement to remayn in their errors. Its not allwayes diſcretion to decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the truth itſelf (when there is no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of declaring it, as in this there could be none: for the Nobility, which, he ſayes, propoſed him that queſtion, were they Catholiks or Proteſtants? if Catholicks its manifeſt, they needed not to be inſtructed in that truth; its no fundamental point of Religion. If Proteſtants, they were not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41955:94"/>obliged to know it, for the ſame reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, that the anſwer was an encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them to remayn as they were, and ſeek no inſtruction; and wheras they made that queſtion it ſeems they doubted if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible ignorance was ſufficient; and if that anſwer had not been giuen; lykely the would ſecure their ſaluation by ſeeking inſtruction. This is the indiſcretion, for which he was cenſured. Now wee will deſcend to the errors which he fixs on the Church of Rome.</p>

               <p>HE forſakes the Catholick Church for her errors, and which be they? the firſt, is the Popes infallibility: if this be an error, its not of the Church, for as I haue shewen ch. 5. its no Arcicle of Faith that the Pope is infallible; if he mislyked that doctrin, he might haue denied it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Catholick. I can not well perceiue what he thinks of the Church vniuerſal; whether he belieues her infallible or no? for, pag. 34. he grants, that the text of S. Paul Tim. 3.15. <hi>The Church is the Pillar and ground of Truth.</hi> Muſt be vnderſtood of the vniuerſal Church; but whether he grants, that thence she is proued infallible or no; I cannot vnderſtand: thence he inferrs; that the Roman Church, that is to ſay the Dioces of Rome, is not infallible, nor the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41955:96"/>Pillar and ground of Truth: but alas he might haue ſpared himſelf that labor; for wee do not belieue, that the Dioces of Rome is an infallible Church; nor that the Pope is infallible: when wee ſay, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church is infallible, wee mean, (and all our Aduerſaries know that) the Church of Rome, and all Churchs vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally ſpread throughout the world, which are vnited with her in Faith and Communion; either as she is diffuſed, or repreſentatiue in a General Council: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin Proteſtants are not included, though a Chriſtian Congregation, becauſe they are deuided from her. This Church is the true vniuerſal Church; called <hi>Roman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the chief Paſtor is in Rome; called <hi>Vaiuerſal,</hi> becauſe her Members are ſpread throughout the world: of the infallibility of this Church, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall ſpeaks nothing, but of the Pop's infallibity, which is no Article of Faith; which, if an error, is not of the Church, and therefore ought not to leaue the Church for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>When our Aduerſaries are obliged, and do promiſe to proue our errors by plain and vndeniable Scripture, from the pag. 29. to 35. and from pag. 39. to 44. where
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41955:96"/>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall vnder takes to proue this error, not one text of Scripture does he alleadge, but three, ſo far from being plain and vndeniable, that any man of common ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe will find them impertinent: the firſt pſ. 11.1. <hi>verities are m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Two reaſons he alleadgs, that <hi>infallibility</hi> is an Attribut proper to God; and that there muſt be no ſuch thing as infallibility of the Church, wheras our Authors do not agree, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to place it; if in the Pope alone, or in the Council: to which reaſons I haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered in the beginning of the 5. ch. He ſayes, that the text of S.

                  <hi>the Council of Conſtance commanded the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Popes to be preferred before the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt; vvheras hauing confeſſed, that our ſauior did ordain the Communion vnder both kinds to the Layty, and that the Apoſtles did practiſe it; they commanded it should be giuen for the future but in one kind, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for reaſon that the precedent Popes and Church did practiſe it ſo: vvhich is to extoll the Decrees of Popes aboue them of Chriſt: as if the Lavvs of England, vvere not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or practifed in Ireland, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the vvill and declaration of the King of France, certainly the King of France vvould be deemed of more Povver in Ireland, than the King of England, and the People more his ſubiects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer: Bellarmin in that place ſpeaks expresly of vices and virtues, when there is a doubt of their being ſuch: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>vſury</hi> is a vice of its nature bad: <hi>(per ſe malum)</hi> now wee all know it to be ſuch; and <hi>reſtitution</hi> to be a virtue: if there should arryſe a doubt of <hi>vſury's</hi> being a vice; and in that caſe the Pope should command <hi>vſury</hi> to be practiſed: then wee should be obliged to practiſe vſury: and <hi>Bellar.</hi> giues the reaſon; <hi>quia tenetur Eccleſia in rebus dubys acquieſcere iudicio ſummi Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficis.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41955:98"/>Becauſe in dubious caſes the Church is obliged to obey the Pope.</hi> Behold how Bellar: ſpeaks in caſe of doubt that vice is vice, and virtue is virtue: for in that caſe the Pope, as being the chief Paſtor, is in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the obligation of being obeyed by Gods command, and a doubtfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe cannot exempt the ſubiects from their apparent duty. <hi>Melior eſt conditio poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council of Conſtance knew, that though the Communion was inſtituted, and practiſed by the Apoſtles in both kinds; yet Chriſt left it arbitrary to his Church to giue it either in one or both, which I will proue in the diſcourſe of <hi>Half Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;</hi> and therefore finding that Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles ſomtymes gaue it in one; and that the precedent Popes for iuſt reaſons had commanded it should be receiued ſo; iſſued that Decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceuing it in one kind. And it is falſe what you ſay that they alleadged no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſo doing but the Decrees of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Popes; they alleadged alſo for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the example of Chriſt and his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les who gaue it in one kind. Though Chriſt washed his Diſciples feet before he gaue the Communion. Might not the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41955:99"/>Council ſay, <hi>Notvvithſtanding that Chriſt did vvash the Receiuers feet, yet vvee do not require that ceremony?</hi> becauſe that though he did ſo, he did no oblige vs to it: its ſo in this caſe; though in the inſtitution he gaue both kinds; he did not oblige to giue both; and therefore the Council might haue commanded to giue but one: which was not to prefer their Decrees to his inſtitution; but to make vſe of the Power he gaue them. Your example of the King of <hi>France</hi> proues againſt you: for if the King of <hi>France</hi> had the Power and command from him of England, to interpret the Laws; and the <hi>Irish</hi> were commanded by him to vnderſtand and practiſe them, as the King of <hi>France</hi> should interpret them, and not otherwſe; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you would not ſay in that caſe, that the King of France woul haue more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Prower in Ireland, than the King of England; if to flatter his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, you haue not a mind tn ſay, that the Lord Lieutenant has more Prower in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, than the King and ſo bid fayre for a haulter.</p>
               <p>Another example to proue wee extoll the Papal Laws aboue the Diuine: <hi>Coſterus,</hi> ſayes he, c. 15. (17. he sould haue ſaid)
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41955:99"/>prop. 9. doubts not to auerr, that it is a greater ſin in a Prieſt to Marry, which he confeſſes is but a tranſgreſſion of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Law; than to keep a Concubin, which is againſt the Law of God. You belye Coſterus in ſaying that the Marriage of a Prieſt is but a tranſgreſſion of a Papal Law; Though it be but a Papal Law, that any who receiueth Prieſthood, shall make a vow of Chaſtity; yet the vow being once made, its a tranſgreſſion againſt the Diuine Law to violat it: a breach of vow a ſacriledg, ſayes Coſterus. And this being euident; its no leſs that it is agreater ſin for him to marry; firſt becauſe he shews by marrying that he is an Heretick, belieuing that to be a marriage, which really is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Secondly, by marrying he teſtifies a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſolution of perſeuearing in the ſin.</p>
               <p>Canus, ſayes he, and others cited by him, do auer that the Church can err <hi>materially,</hi> and conſequently allows no more infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the Church, than to a priuat Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: Anſwer. Canus and other Diuins ſay that the Church an err <hi>materially</hi> in matters of <hi>fact;</hi> as I will declare in the next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Point; but in Points of Doctrin, no Catholick ſayes that the Church can err, nor materially; and Priuat Doctors can
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41955:100"/>err not only materially but formally. Laſtly he impugns our Doctrin of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with an argument as old as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: becauſe wee cannot proue it but by Scripture, and wee proue Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re again by the infaillibility of the Church; and this again by Scripture; and ſo go ſtill round in circle, which is ridiculous in the ſchools: and hence he takes occaſion to pick aquarrel with Becanus; to no other effect, but that his Auditory should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he was acquainted with the works of great Diuins. But I will declare how wee can eaſily expound the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith without any Circle; which I am ſure the Proteſtants will neuer do.</p>
               <p>An act of Faith, is an Aſſent to a truth which is obſcure and reaſon cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend (<hi>an argument</hi> of things not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſayes S. Paul) only becauſe it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propoſed to vs, that God reuealed it: and therefore S. Paul calls it a <hi>captiuating of our vnderſtanding,</hi> which is to ſay ſumiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Reaſon. By <hi>Reſolution of Faith</hi> the Diuins vnderſtand, To declare the <hi>Motiue,</hi> why I belieue, or the ground whervpon our Faith doth reſt.</p>
               <p>God doth not require of vs to belieue ſuddainly that a doctrin is reuealed by him,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41955:100"/>becauſe the Proponent tells vs ſo. S. Peter calls Faith, a <hi>Reaſonable Obſequy:</hi> wee muſt haue ſtrong reaſons to moue vs for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue a Truth to be reuealed before wee giue our Aſſent: therefore, before the Act of Faith (and in human Faith alſo its ſo) wee haue ſom inward diſpoſitions preuious to the Aſſent, a good opinion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent for his lyfe, for his actions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, which prepare our vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repreſenting it reaſonable to belieue what is propoſed. Chriſt himſelf, when he came to preach, did not oblige the Iews to belieue abruptly, that he was the ſon of God, but began with a Holy lyfe, admirable doctrin, miracles and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſigns, and theſe were preuious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prepare them, that hauing ſuch ſtrong and credible Motiues, for to iudge him a Perſon aboue the rank of Ordinary men, they should belieue him, when he should teach them, that he was the ſon of God; wheras it was incredible that God should credit him with ſuch ſupernatural works, and continual marks of his beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, if he were an impoſtor.</p>
               <p>This appears in the paſſage of the Blind man cured by Chriſts Io. c. 9. the Scribs and Phariſees ſaid Chriſt was a ſinner; the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41955:101"/>Blind Man argued, No; in as much as he worked ſo great a miracle in him: <hi>Niſi hic homo eſſet à Deo, non poterat facere quid quam: if this man vvere not from God he could do nothing:</hi> all this whyle, he did not belieue that Chriſt was God; but <hi>a man from God,</hi> extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fauored by him. He being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with theſe external Motiues, and iudgment of credibility, wherby he iudged Chriſt to be ſomwhat more than ordinary; Chriſt meets him again, and bids him <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in the ſon of God, yea,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>vvho is he:</hi> (behold how he was ready, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by that precedent iudgment, for to belieue) <hi>He that ſpeaks to you, is he,</hi> ſaid Chriſt: and preſently he belieued: <hi>Credo Domine.</hi> You ſee the Motiue of his Aſſent, was the teſtimony of Chriſt; which he thought, he was bound to belieue, hauing formerly ſeen his works; which made it euidently credible to him that he muſt ſpeake but truth; wheras they proued him to be a man from God. Thus the People of Samaria, belieued him to be the ſon of God, when they did heare him; becauſe they were preuiously diſpoſed by the words of the Samaritan, and the miracle, she related of him. Thus the Prophets and Apoſtles proceeded, preparing their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41955:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>with the Holyneſs of their lyues, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret energy of their doctrin, miracles and ſupernatural ſigns, which moued men to iudge that they were ſent by God; and that they could not be Cheats, and the People, (which is to be obſerued) would be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged obſtinat, and were iudged obſtinat, ſuch as did not belieue their doctrin, when they did ſee them; or, though they did not ſee them, but were credibly informed by thoſe that did ſee them.</p>
               <p>Wee haue in the former part of this Treatiſe shewen the great inducements and Motiues wee haue to iudge that the Roman Catholick Church, beyond all Congregations in the word, is particularly fauored by God; the ſanctity of her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, the conuerſion of Nations by her, vnto a doctrin ſo ſeemingly contrary to reaſon, and irkſom to our natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; miracles wrought by her in all ages, the conſtancy of her Martyrs, euen in the youngeſt age and weaker ſex. Her vnity in doctrin, againſt the perſecutions of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tyrants and Hereſiarks that almoſt all ages oppoſed it; theſe marks which are proper only to her; and that no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation can claim, makes it euidently credible, that if God ſpeaks to vs by the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41955:102"/>mouth of any, it muſt be by hers. The lyke, and no other, had the Primitiue Church, to iudge of the Apoſtles that God ſpoke by them: and ſuch as in the Apoſtles tymes did not belieue them, hauing ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to iudge them men of God, were condemned for obſtinat people: and conſequently who will not iudge the ſame of this Church, ought alſo to be held for obſtinat, notwithſtanding any pretence of ignorance they may alleadge.</p>
               <p>Hauing theſe inducements to prepare our vnderſtandings for Faith, it follows, that what euer this Church propoſes vnto vs, to be a Truth reuealed by God; wee are obliged to belieue her, and embrace her doctrin vpon her teſtimony; wheras it appears by thoſe inducements ſo credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that God ſpeaks by her as he did by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Now I reſolue my Faith thus: you ask why I belieue the Trinity? I anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God has reuealed it. You ask why I belieue, that God reuealed it? I anſwer, becauſe the Church, by which God ſpeaks tell vs ſo. You ask, why I belieue, that God ſpeakes by the Church? (heere is the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:) I muſt not anſwer, becauſe the Scripture ſayes it, for I belieue Scripture only vpon
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41955:102"/>the teſtimony of the infallible Church, and to proue again the infallibility of this, by the Scripture, would be a circle: neither muſt I anſwer, that I belieue God to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke by the Church, becauſe she works mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, for if the miracles be abſolutly eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they can be no <hi>Motiue</hi> of Faith, which is of its own nature obſcure: and if they be but morally euident miracles, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the <hi>Motiue,</hi> becauſe the motiue of Faith muſt be infallible; and becauſe the <hi>Motiue</hi> of an Act of Faith muſt be Gods word, and miracles are not Gods word, but ſigns and Marks of his word. Wee muſt therefore anſwer to that queſtion again, <hi>becauſe the Church by vvhich God ſpeakes, ſaies, that God ſpeakes by her, and I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to belieue he ſpeaks by her becauſe he does credit her vvith ſo many miracles and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Marks, vvhich makes it euidently cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that he does ſpeake by her.</hi> Where you diſtinguish the <hi>Motiue</hi> of your Act of Faith, from the <hi>Motiue</hi> of your <hi>obligation</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing, and <hi>your iudgment</hi> of credibility: the <hi>Motiue,</hi> that you giue for your Act of Faith, is only the word or voyce of God by the Church: (and nothing els but the word of God can be the Motiue of Faith.) the Motiue you giue for your <hi>obligation</hi> of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41955:103"/>belieuing, and <hi>iudgment of credibility;</hi> are the external inducements of miracles and ſupernatural ſigns. You reply: To belieue that God ſpeaks by the Church, becauſe the Church by which God ſpeaks ſayes ſo; is to belieue that God ſpeaks, becauſe Gods ſpeaks by the Church; which is <hi>idem per idem:</hi> to belieue a thing for itſelf; and an obſcure thing, for a thing equally obſcure; which is vnreaſonable; wheras an obſcure vnknowen thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be belieued but for ſomthing that is more cleer and knowen. I anſwer, what is belieued, is that God ſpeaks by the Church, which is obſcure and vnknowen to our reaſon: The <hi>Motiue,</hi> why wee belieue it, is the voyce of God by the Church, euidently propoſed to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by the external Motiues of credibility to be credibly his voyce; ſo that the ſame thing which of itſelf, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without the external Motiues of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, is obſcure and vnknowen; acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the motiues of credibility is more cleer and knowen and moues me to belieue: but ſo, that the Motiues of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are not the <hi>Motiue,</hi> nor any part of the <hi>Motiue</hi> why I belieue the teſtimony of the Church to be the voyce of God; but are the Motiues why our vnderſtanding
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41955:103"/>euidently knows it to be very credible, and iudges it very iuſt and reaſonable that wee should belieue it to be the voyce of God.</p>
               <p>And that this is the way of Reſoluing Diuine Faith, its proued; for wee haue the ſame Faith, that the Primitiue Church of Ieruſalem, Antioch, and Damaſco had: and conſequently wee muſt haue the ſame <hi>Motiue</hi> of Faith. When the Apoſtles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them, they belieued the Trinity, not for Scripture; for but little or nothing was then written of the new Teſtament; but becauſe God told them by the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that it was a reuealed Truth. And if you did ask them, whey they belieued that God did ſpeake by the Apoſtles? they would anſwer, becauſe the Apoſtles who were Gods Meſſengers told them ſo, and they could not but be obliged to belieue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their miracles and ſupernatural ſigns. Thus wee ſay of the Church.</p>
               <p>Now the Church being belieued infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true; wee belieue the Scripture to be the word of God vpon her teſtimony; and the Scripture being belieued Gods word; then wee draw out of the Scripture, new proofs and Motiues of belieuing the Church to be infallible; becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is the word of God ſayes it.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41955:104"/>But the chief and laſt Motiue whervpon our Faith muſt reſt, is the word of God ſpeaking to vs by the Church: the Church, I ſay by which God actually, in this preſent age ſpeaks vnto vs: for wee do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue becauſe God did ſpeak in the 1.2. and third age by the Church; for that is <hi>Tradition,</hi> and Tradition (nor Scripture) is not the <hi>Motiue,</hi> but the <hi>Rule</hi> of our Faith; the <hi>Rule</hi> by which the Church is guided to know which and what is the word of God: the <hi>Motiue</hi> of our Faith, is becauſe God ſpeaks now, by his Church, as he did in thoſe firſt ages; for which wee haue euident arguments of credibility as the firſt ages had.</p>

               <p>What is belieued, as an Article of Faith by the Church, is the ſpiritual ſupremacy of the Pope: his ſupream Power either <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> or <hi>indirect</hi> in temporal affaires ouer Princes, is no Articles of Faith; but a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſputed in the ſchools, and neither Partie, that denies or affirms is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Hereſy by the Church; if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall mislyked the Doctrin he might haue diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, and remain a Catholick, as many

                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:41955:106"/>was that Chriſt should giue them to eate his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real flesh,</hi> for no man could apprehend any difficulty in that Chriſt should giue the figure of his Body, wheras they did eat yearly the Paſchal Lamb, which they belieued to be the figure, of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias; Chriſt promiſed what they iudged <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>impoſsible;</hi> what they iudged <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>impoſsible,</hi> was not that he should giue a <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of his flesh, but his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real flesh;</hi> therefore what Chriſt promiſed was not a figure but his real and true flesh: and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall himſelf, pag. 63. does acknowledge, that the Iews did vnderſtand Chriſt to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his true and real flesh: <hi>The Ievvs vnderſtood him to haue ſpoken of a corporal and fleshy eating, as the Papiſts do.</hi> Now anſwer me, I pray, to this ſyllogiſm: A damnable vnbelieuer is he who denies a Truth ſufficiently propoſed to him to be reuealed by God; The Iewes in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were damnable vnbelieuers, and what they denied was a fleshy eating of his real Body, as the Papiſts belieue it: therefore Chriſt in this occaſion did ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vnto them a fleashy eating of his real Body as the Papiſts belieue it.</p>
               <p>Pag. 63. he rayſes an argument vpon this text for the figuratiue preſence: for ſayes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41955:107"/>
                  <hi>he the Ievvs vnderſtood him to ſpeake of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and fleshy eating of his Body, as Papiſts do, and ſo repreſented difficulties that reaſon dictated againſt the lyke expreſsions, as vvee did in the beginning of this diſcourſe; but he did correct their vnderſtanding, by his ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent vvords,</hi> v. 63. <hi>it is the ſpirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the flesh profiteth nothing, the vvords that I ſpeak are ſpirit and lyfe by vvhich he dravveth them from the apprehenſion of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral eating, to that of a ſpiritual feeding:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Chriſt did meane a figuratiue ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eating of his flesh: thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall.</p>
               <p>By this, you acknowledge, that the Iews did not apprehend or think of any figuratiue eating, conſequently they could not either belieue it, or deny it; for how can a man deny, that which neuer fell into his apprehenſions: tell vs therefore what is that which they denyed, and denyed dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably? they could not deny, but that which they apprehended was ſpoken; and what they apprehended, as you confeſs, was a corporal fleshy eating. That therefore they muſt haue denyed; therefore they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>vnbelieuers:</hi> but how were they <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably</hi> vnbelieuers, if Chriſt did not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and credibly propoſe vnto them a corporal and fleshly eating? For none is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41955:107"/>bound to belieue, if the reuealed Truth be not ſufficiently and credibly propoſed to him? either therefore Chriſt his words, <hi>My flesh is truly meat, my Blood is truly drink,</hi> did ſufficiently and credibly propoſe a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eating of his real flesh, or they ought not to be called <hi>damnably vnbelieuers.</hi> They would not belieue that corporal eating of his real flesh, as you do not, for the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which reaſon dictated againſt the lyke expreſſions; ſuch as you, and your fraternity, propoſes againſt them; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore wee ſay, that you are damnably <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieuers,</hi> as they were, and you, and they are checkt by thoſe wordes of Chriſt, <hi>the flesh profiteth nothing, its the ſpirit that quickneth, &amp;c,</hi> which were not to check their vnderſtanding for apprehending a corporal eating; but to check their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, that for the difficulties, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon did ſuggeſt againſt his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they would not belieue, what he ſpoke, and they vnderſtood him to haue ſpoken: <hi>the flesh profiteth nothing,</hi> that was to ſay to them and to you, that they muſt not iudge of this Myſtery by the ſenſes of the flesh, nor by natural reaſon which is adquired by the help of the fleshy ſenſes, They cannot vnderſtand how that can be:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41955:108"/>
                  <hi>Its the ſpirit that quickneth,</hi> thats to ſay, its the Diuine grace, that muſt enlighten your vnderſtandings to know and belieue how this can be. Euen as when S. Peter confeſſed Chiſt to be <hi>the ſon of the liuing God,</hi> Chriſt added, <hi>its not flesh and blood that reuealed that vnto thee, but my Father that is in heauen,</hi> Mat. 16 17. which was to ſay; that it was not natural reaſon, nor any knowledge of the ſenſes of flesh, or gotten by them; but the grace of the heauenly Father that diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Myſtery to him.</p>
               <p>If you reade that paſſage in S. Io. 6. you will find, that Chriſt as wee haue euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued, propoſed a corporal eating of his real flesh, but did not at all then (which is to be obſerued) propoſe the manner, how he would giue his flesh to be eaten. The obligation of the Iews was to belieue that he would giue it; and not to diſpute, <hi>hovv</hi> that could be, or in what manner: but they began to think how it could be, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo poteſt, &amp;c.</hi> and their natural reaſon, (which only they conſulted) not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that it could be otherwyſe, than by cutting his flesh in morſels to be giuen to them, this appearing ſo abſurd to human reaſon, they abſolutly denyed, the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Myſtery. If Chriſt when he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41955:108"/>propoſed to them his flesh for food, had alſo propoſed the manner that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of giuing it, perhaps they would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue belieued, but then he did not, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the eating of his flesh. Their error was two fold; the one, that they denyed the poſſibility of giuing his flesh to be eaten; for which they were called vnbelieuers: the other was the cauſe, why they denyed it; becauſe the manner of eating it which their natural reaſon propoſed vnto them, appeared abſurd, and therefore not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing how it could be they denyed it; therefore Chriſt checkt this their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the manner of giuing his flesh really to be eaten was in a ſpiritual way, aboue what their natural reaſon could apprehend, and ſayd <hi>its the Spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth nothing;</hi> as wee haue expounded: but they, either becauſe they did not vnderſtand this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or that they obſtinatly adheared to their firſt denyal, flincht from him.</p>
               <p>I conclude with this reaſon: you will not deny but that God might, if he we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pleaſed, haue conuerted the ſubſtance of that bread, which he took in his hands, into his real flesh and Body; as by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent word he created all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41955:109"/>as he conuerted the water into wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; and as the bread, which wee eat, is by the heat of our ſtomacks conuerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our flesh and blood: ſuppoſe, I pray, that he intended at the laſt ſupper to make ſuch a change; or that now he deſcended from heauen to make it: what words could he vſe, more ſignificant, to let vs vnderſtand that he gaue vs his real and true Body vnder the Accidents of bread, than thoſe, <hi>take, eat, this is my Body vvhich is giuen for you, this is truly my flesh:</hi> if in a ſerious diſcourſe I promiſed you a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe; would not you vnderſtand that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to giue you a true horſe? would I perform my promomiſs by giuing the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of one? ſince then that he might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue giuen vs, if he had been pleaſed, his true and real Body, and that he ſpoke, as if really he did intend it, (for he could not ſpeake otherwyſe if he did) wee muſt vnderſtand that he did intend it, and gaue it. If he did intend it, when he ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke thoſe words; what could hinder him? if he did not intend it; was it ſincerity and honeſty to ſpeake otherwyſe, than as he intended? no more than if you, hauing promiſed a horſe, would giue only the picture of one.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:41955:109"/>
               <p>Let vs heare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls arguments; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, as the Iews, with difficulties that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon propoſes againſt ſo great a Myſtery; that the Accidents of bread should be without any ſubſtance to reſt on, that a Body would be at one tyme in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that a well proportioned body should be confined to the ſmale compaſs of a wafer; that the Accidents conuerted into vermin should produce a ſubſtance. I would tyre my Readers patience, if I did ſcan each triuial objection of theſe that has been a hundred tymes anſwered, and our anſwers neuer replyed vnto. You would haue shewen more wit, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, and got more credit by replying to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that our writers giue to theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections and eſpecially Bellarmin from whom you borrow them, than by repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again a parcel of thrid bare tryfles, againſt ſo great a Myſtery, in homage of which, wee muſt captiuat our ſence and reaſon, as wee do to the Myſtery of the Trinity, which ſurpaſſeth all created in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects, far more than this Myſtery and yet not ſo cleerly expreſſed in Scripture, as this is. And if you muſt haue natural reaſon, for to belieue this Myſtery, tell me, what reaſon haue you for to belieue
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41955:110"/>that the Bread and wyne giueth lyfe and grace to the worthy eater? what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can reaſon find betwixt bread, and Diuin grace? what proportion betwixt the water of Baptiſm, and ſpiritual Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? none, if you do not appeale to the omnipotency of God: by he ſame wee anſwer you alſo, (to shun tedious Tatalogyes) that thoſe difficulties you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent be impoſſible to Nature but they are poſſible to the omnipotent word of God.</p>
               <p>But for the ſatisfaction of the Reader I will deliuer this argument in the terms of an ingenious man which once I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with. This Myſtery, ſaid he, is repugnant to ſenſe and reaſon; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is not to be impoſed on man, if God will not haue him to renounce both. Its repugnant to ſenſe, for what wee ſee, taſt, and feel, is but bread: repugnant to reaſon; for this ought prudently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the ſubſtance of bread is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, vpon the teſtimony of the ſenſes, which perceiue the Accidents that, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe, are inſeparable from the ſubſtance of bread. I anſwer, Reaſon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ought to conclude the ſubſtance of bread is there, wheras the ſenſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41955:110"/>the Accidents, which are naturally inſeparable from that ſubſtance, if there were not a higher Authority that affirms the ſubſtance is not there; to whoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, Reaſon is bound to yield, againſt the euidence of the ſenſes: as when the Angel appeared to Tobias to acompany him in his voyage; Tobias, at his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ch. 5. prudently iudged him to be a Man, wheras the ſenſes did perceiue all the Accidents proper to human Nature; and nothing affirmed him to be an Angel: there Reaſon prudently concluded vpon the teſtimony of the ſenſes: but when in the 12. ch. the Angel diſcouered him ſelf to be an Angel; then Tobias his reaſon was reclaymed, and againſt the euidence of his ſenſes, which did ſee nothing but Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Human Nature; belieued it a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vpon the teſtimony of an Angel. The lyke paſſage wee read to haue happened to Abraham, Gen. 18. whence wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that God may ſeparat the Accidents from the ſubſtance to which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and alſo that when the teſtimony of our ſenſes clashs with a higher Authority, Reaſon muſt yield to the higher Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, againſt the euidence of our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>This is the preſent caſe: our ſenſes ſay
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41955:111"/>its bread what wee ſee after the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the word of God ſayes its his Body; if the word of God did not oueraw the ſenſes, reaſon ought prudently to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de its <hi>bread;</hi> but the word of God being of a more infallible authority than the ſenſes, Reaſon muſt yield to the word of God, and ſay its Chriſts <hi>Body;</hi> againſt the euidence of the ſenſes that ſaye its <hi>bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But replyed he, God will not haue Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon go againſt the euidence of our ſenſes, but yeld to them euen in matters of Faith; for after his Reſurrection he proued it to his Apoſtles by the euidence of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſaying Lu. 24.36. <hi>feele and ſee for a Spirit hath no flesh nor boans as you ſee me to haue.</hi> I anſwer, they did not belieue his Reſurrection only vpon the teſtimony of their ſenſes, but alſo of his word and aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueration, that ſaid he was reuiued. God will haue vs, as I ſaid formerly, yield to the euidence of our ſenſes, when there is no higher authority that thwarts their eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as heere there was none, but the higher autority did rather aſſert, what the ſenſes did teſtifie, but in the Myſtery of the Euchariſt it is not ſo; Gods word does contradict the ſenſes, and therefore Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt, yield to it againſt our ſenſations.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:41955:111"/>
               <p>Pag. 21. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall argues, that no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vrges vs to belieue Chriſts real preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in the Sacrament; neither for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that he promiſes by it: not for the verifying of his words, ſeeing our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaid in the ſame tenor, <hi>I am the true vine;</hi> without any alteration in the vine, or his perſon: not for the effects of the Sacrament; Chriſt being able to conferr, what ſpiritual graces he pleaſes, with the worthy receiuing of bread and wyne, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout any ſubſtantial alteration in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as in the water of Baptiſm he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth the ſoueraign grace of ſpiritual regeneration in the ſubſtance of water.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, its neceſſary for the verifying of Chriſts words in the inſtitution of the Sacrament: for let the words <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>flesh, vine, Rock &amp;c.</hi> be <hi>equiuocal,</hi> as he will haue them to be; indifferent to beare two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>figuratiue</hi> and <hi>real.</hi> This is euident, that when a word bearing an <hi>equiuocal</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is put in a Propoſition, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſignify that, of which only, and of no other, the <hi>Predicat</hi> can be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed: as this word <hi>Man,</hi> may ſignify a true, or painted man: in this propoſition <hi>Man is a rational liuing creature,</hi> it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſignify a true Man; becauſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41955:112"/>the <hi>Predicat, rational liuing creature,</hi> can be verifyed only of him, and not of a painted man. So the word <hi>Body,</hi> that may ſignify a true, or figuratiue one; in the inſtitution of the Sacrament, <hi>This is my body vvhich is giuen for you,</hi> its determined to ſignify Chriſt his true body, becauſe of it only, and not of a figure, it can be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed <hi>vvhich is giuen for you.</hi> If you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this Principle, you will cleerly anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer any text that may be alleadged againſt this Myſtery. As to the inſtance of <hi>vine</hi> and ſuch lyke myſtical expreſſions ſpoken of Chriſt, put them in a propoſition with the word <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and they will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to a figuratiue or myſtical ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe that <hi>Chriſt that dyed for</hi> vs cannot be ſaid of a vine or Rock in their proper ſignification.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſecond part of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that God might, had he been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, haue redeemed vs, with out any real Incarnation of the ſecond Perſon, or real Paſſion of Chriſt vpon the Croſs, its out of controuerſy; for his infinit wysdom and Power, wanted not other means for to redeem vs: is it therefore wee muſt ſay, with the Heretick <hi>Marcion,</hi> that the text, <hi>And the vvord vvas made flesh,</hi> muſt be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41955:112"/>vnderſtood figuratiuly, and deny any real Incarnation of Chriſt, or Paſſion, on the Croſs, but only a figuratiue one? by your argument wee might, becauſe God might, had he been pleaſed, conuey vnto vs by a figuratiue body and Paſſion, all the effects and grace, that he conueyed vnto vs by a real Incarnation and Paſſion: the ſpiritual regeneration, conferred on vs in Baptiſm by water, he might haue conferred it on vs by wine or Roſe water: is it therefore wee muſt ſay that true natural water is not neceſſary for Baptiſm? but ſay you, the text does diſtinctly expreſs <hi>vvater;</hi> yea, and the text in the inſtitution of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt does diſtinctly expreſs <hi>Body:</hi> and as the text does not add, <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Body, ſo it does not add <hi>true</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> water; by what rule, muſt <hi>vvater</hi> in the text ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify <hi>natural</hi> water, and the word <hi>Body,</hi> muſt not ſygnify a real body?</p>
               <p>Thus farr wee agree that Chriſt might, were he pleaſed, haue giuen vs the effects of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by a figuratiue Preſence only; alſo that he might haue conferred them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs by the real preſence of his Body (for there is no impoſſibility in that he should haue giuenvs his real Body vnder the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread) the queſtion is, what is it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41955:113"/>that he has effectually don, and which of the two has he giuen, the figure of his Body, or his real Body? I ſay that his real Body, for that is requiſit for the verifying of his words in the inſtitution of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But why does S. Paul call it <hi>Bread</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; euen after the conſecration? as 1. Cor. 11.13. <hi>as often as you eat this bread, vvhoeuer shall eat this bread, he took bread in his hands he brake it and ſaid this is my Body vvhich is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you.</hi> Theſe expreſſions denote, that it remayns ſtill bread. No M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, it retains the name of bread, becauſe it retains the appearance of bread, and becauſe that when a thing is changed into an other, it ſtill retains the name of what it was, as in the Scripture wee read, <hi>the blind ſee, the lame vvalk;</hi> though they ſee, they are called <hi>blind,</hi> becauſe they were blind, and are reſtored to their ſight. And S. Io. 2.9. ſayes; <hi>vvhen the Ruler of the feaſt, had taſted the vvater, that vvas made vvine.</hi> The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that the Ruler of the feaſt taſted was true wine; yet the text calls it <hi>vvater,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from water it was conuerted into wine. So the bread, which by the words of the conſecration, is conuerted into Chriſt his Body, retains the name of bread, becauſe it was once bread; becauſe it has
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41955:113"/>ſtill the appearance of bread, and becauſe wee should vnderſtand, that true bread and wyne, and nothing but bread and wyne, is requiſit for the due adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Sacrament; as for the Baptiſm true natural water is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>And that you may not be ſtartled at S. Pauls calling it ſo often <hi>bread,</hi> obſerue you the rule I haue giuen, and you will eaſily perceiue that the word <hi>bread</hi> ſo often vſed after the conſecration, ſignifyes not true and real bread, but beares only a myſtical or figuratiue ſignification, for you will find that the Predicats that are ſaid of that bread after its conſecration, cannot, in any wyſe, be verified of true ſubſtantial bread; and conſequently that the word <hi>bread</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conſecration cannot ſignify real, but figuratiue bread, for example Chriſt ſayes of that bread that S. Paul ſpeakes of; <hi>the bread that I shall giue is flesh for the lyfe of the vvorld:</hi> what was giuen for the lyfe of the world, was not <hi>true bread,</hi> but <hi>true flesh,</hi> conſequently when that flesh is called bread, the word <hi>bread</hi> muſt not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify real bread. Chriſt ſayes of that bread, <hi>this is my Body, vvhich is giuen for you:</hi> This Predicat, <hi>vvhich is giuen for you,</hi> cannot be verified of bread, in its true and proper
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41955:114"/>ſignification; conſequently the word <hi>bread</hi> after the conſecration, ſignifyes but figuratiue bread, the appearance of bread.</p>
               <p>But ſayes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, wee all agree in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Euchariſt a Sacrament, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is but a ſign of a ſacred thing; why should not wee agree alſo, in calling the Sacrament of Chriſt his body, <hi>the ſign of Chriſt his Body:</hi> and heere he brings a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody of texts of S. Auguſtin, S. Denis, and others, to proue that it is but a type, a Symbol, a figure, and remembrance of Chriſt his Body, which labor he might haue well ſpared; for wee do freely grant that the Eurachiſt is a ſign, type, remembrance and Symbol of Chriſt his body offered for vs on the Croſs; the Euchariſt is a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, and repreſentation of that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifice; but it is alſo Chriſt his true Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: the vnbloody oblation of his Body in the Euchariſt, is a figure and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bloody oblation of the ſame body on the Croſs; as a King that would act a Part in a tragedy of his own victoryes, he would be the thing repreſented and the repreſentation. He alleadges the words of ſome Fathers of the Church, that expresly ſay the Symbols in the Sacrament are not

And is it not a pretty thing that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants would perſwade vs, that theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and others, did belieue only a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue Preſence, and yet from the very firſt begining of their pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they conſtantly auerr, that all the Fathers fell into the errours of Purgatory, real Preſence, Adoration of Saints, &amp;c. whoeuer will read thoſe Fathers will find the real Preſence moſt cleerly aſſerted in ſeueral places of their works; eſpecially in S. Chryſoſt.; and for one or two obſcure paſſages, or expreſſions, that our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes meet, with they muſt be for a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Preſence? Bellarmin and our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authors, giue a Catholick ſence to thoſe words; the Proteſtants giue an other, the Fathers do not liue to ſpeake for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41955:115"/>and declare what ſenſe they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: is it not neceſſary therefore, that wee should haue an infallible liuing iudge, who may deliuer vnto vs, what wee muſt belieue in this Myſtery?</p>
               <p>This aduertiſment I muſt giue my Reader; that the Fathers in all ages of the Church, ſome ſpoke nothing at all of the Myſteryes now controuerted, and belieued by vs, others ſpoke of them but briefly and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely; others wrote in ſome places of their works plainly, and diſtinctly; but in other places in expreſſions, ſubiect to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction. The reaſon was, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of each age profeſſedly writ, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or for the moſt part of their works, of thoſe points of doctrin which were oppoſed by the Hereticks of thoſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and thoſe they deliuered in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Notions, expresly, and carefully, shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any dubious words; but of other Myſteryes and Articles of Faith, that were vnanimously belieued, no contradiction of Hereticks requiring an exact diſcuſſion of them; either they omitted to ſpeake of them, or writing of them, they were not ſo carefull in ſpeaking with cleer expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, becauſe they had no occaſion of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a misconſtruction of their words; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41955:115"/>when in other places of their works, they had deliuered themſelues in plain terms. Hence it is that wee muſt not be ſtartled if wee do not find any mention of Indulgences, Purgatory, or real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in ſome Fathers; or if wee meet ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me words in ſome Fathers, which may be wreſted againſt our Tenets; as in this of the real Preſence, which vntill about the yeare 800. had not any oppoſition among Chriſtians, then it was appoſed by Iohn Scotus (not the Franciſcan fryer) and by the Arch Bishop of <hi>Sens</hi> in France: but this ſtorm was ſoon and eaſily calm'd: about the yeare 1100. <hi>Berengarius</hi> rayſed much duſt againſt this Myſtery, and drew many Abettors to his faction; then the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick writters did declare the Myſtery and defend it, and <hi>Berengarius</hi> was condemned by fiue Councils ſucceſſiuly aſſembled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and his Partizans: the Fathers who writ ſince that tyme ſpeake ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly in fauor of the real Preſence, that you will hardly find any expreſſion in their works wherat your vnderſtanding may ſtumble.</p>
               <p>Its moſt falſe what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall imputes to Scotus, Ocham and other more modern Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that the doctrin of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41955:116"/>it not contained in the Canon, nor was an Article of Faith before the Lateran Council; they expresly teach, eſpecialy Scotus in 4. diſt. 11. q 3. that the doctrin was belieued before the Council, continually in the Church; but more explicitly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Council, who for that end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which expreſſes better the doctrin belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as the Council of Nice introduced the word <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> to ſignify the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſon with the Father: nay Scotus in that place brings for example the Creed of the Nicen Council which, ſayes he, was no new doctrin of the Council, but a more explicit declaration of the ſence formerly belieued by the Church; ſo the Decree of the Lateran Council was but an explicit declaration of the ſence that was held by the Church in all ages in this point of the real Preſence. <hi>Suarez</hi> indeed tells vs, that Caietan (but ſpeaks nothing of Baſſoly, ſo much you add of your own) ſpoke rashly of this Myſtery, but tells vs alſo that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions were cenſured by the Church; and all that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall can proue by this, is that Caietan did err: and what then?</p>
               <p>But fayes he Bellarmin and the Roman writers do agree that in that text, <hi>this
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41955:116"/>Cup is the nevv Teſtament of my blood,</hi> the word <hi>Cup,</hi> is taken by a Trope, not for the material Cup, but for the thing it contains; and why will wee not alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Trope, in the words relating to the bread conſecrated. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall playes the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick vndoubtedly vnder the mask of Proteſtancy, for this argument proues manifeſtly our Doctrin: wee confeſs that in the text alleadged, the word <hi>Cup</hi> muſt be taken, by a Trope, for what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, not for the material <hi>Cup;</hi> ſo wee deſire him that in this text <hi>the bread vvhich I vvil giue is flesh for the lyfe of the vvorld;</hi> the word <hi>bread,</hi> may be taken by a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, not for the material bread, but for what it contains which wee proue to be in the <hi>Cup,</hi> the true blood of Chriſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it, and not of the material <hi>Cup,</hi> it can be verifyed that it was shed for vs) in the <hi>bread,</hi> the true flesh of Chriſt; for of it, and not of the material bread, that Predicat can be verifyed, <hi>giuen for the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of the vvorld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He concludes with a diſcourſe which shocks the Hierarchy of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Anderton has lately proued in his iudicious Treatyſe ſtiled <hi>a Soueriagn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt Atheiſm and Hereſy,</hi> the Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

How can you (ſayes he) giue Diuin Adol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration to the wafer! wheras in your own Principles you cannot be ſure that Chriſt is there preſent: for in your Principles, That depends of the intention of the Prieſt who conſecrats, and of his true ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this depends of the intention, and due ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Bishop that ordained him; and this Bishop depends of the true ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of others that conſecrated him; and ſo vpwards of endleſs requiſits, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be knowen certainly: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently you cannot certainly know, that Chriſt is preſent in that wafer; how then are you ſo deſperat as to adore it?</p>
               <p>Anſwer: its queſtion leſs on both ſydes, yours and ours, that ſom things are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially requiſit for the validity of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41955:117"/>the defect of which, or any one thing of them nullifyes the Sacrament: as, for the validity of Baptiſm, water is eſſentially neceſſary; and the form of words, <hi>I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize you in the name of the Father ſon and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This you belieue as well as wee, now who doubts, but that it depends of the free will of the Miniſter to vitiat the form; for ſince that the validity of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmdoes not require, that he vters the form in aloud voyce; he may pretend to ſpeak the form, and vtter ſom what els in lieu of it: or if he should pronounce ſome words of it with an audible voyce; he may, with an vnder voyce omit ſome word, or add ſom word, that would deſtroy the form; this may happen through malice or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and wee cannot poſſibly be certain, that it does not, or has not happened; and conſequently wee can haue no aſſurance (if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls diſcourſe be good) of the truth of any mans Baptiſm. The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Miniſters depends eſſentially, in your Principles alſo, as well as in ours, of the Iuriſdiction of the Bishop (for if he be no true Bishop he can giue no orders) and of the exact form, or words eſſentially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit for a due ordination: the Iuriſdiction of the Bishop depends of the due ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41955:118"/>of the Conſecrators (for he muſt be conſecrated by the impoſition of hands of true Bishops) and the vttering of the form of Conſecration; the due ordination of the Conſecrators depends of the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſits in thoſe from whom they receiued their Caracter: now ſince that the defect, either of the true <hi>form</hi> of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of the true Ordination of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrators, nullifies your Hierarchy; and that there is no poſſible means for vs to know certainly that neither of thoſe two, was wanting, in any one of the whole trayn of your Ordainers; for if it was wanting in any all the Ordinations deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from him, are Null, what aſſurance haue you, or can you haue of the truth of your Hierarchy, and but that you are all buth meer laymen without any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or iuriſdiction for preaching or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Sacraments? Thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Church in opening a way to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Iuriſdiction of the Clergy: let him make his peace, as he can, with his Church and Clergy, wee will anſwer his obiection thus.</p>
               <p>Wee can without hazard of Idolatry, and ought in conſcience to adore the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer conſecrated, though wee be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41955:118"/>aſſured of the Prieſts intention: for our obligation of adoring is grounded on, and guided by that General Principle of Faith (which is infallibly true) that Chriſt is really preſent in the wafer duely conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated; this General Principle applied to this particular caſe of <hi>this vvafer,</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by <hi>this Prieſt,</hi> obliges me to adore this wafer, though that application of the ſaid general Principle be not infallibily ſure, or I am not infallibly aſcertained that it is applyed in this particular caſe: it is ſufficient for my obligation of adoring, that I am morally aſſured that it is applyed. As in this caſe, this General Principle of Nature, <hi>Parents are to be honored by their children,</hi> is infallibly true and iuſt; and grounds an obligation in all children to honor their Parents: in virtue of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Principle applyed this particular Man and woman that are your Parents, you are obliged to honor them; but are you infallibly aſſured that theſe are your Parents? not at all: are not you not withs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanding obliged to honor them? is it rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or folly in you to honor them? for though the general Principle that Parents muſt be honored be infallibly true and iuſt, yet you are not infallibly aſſured, that this
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41955:119"/>general Principle is duely applyed to the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in particular; but for your obligation that is not requiſit; its ſufficient that you are morally aſſured: this is our caſe in the adoration of the Hoſt. And hence wee cannot: but condemn your <hi>intollerable</hi> rashneſs in ſaying that, <hi>its an intollerable boldneſs</hi> to auer, that there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the adoration of the Hoſt as there is for the adoration of Chriſts Diuinity; for if you vnderſtand our Doctrin, which is that there is <hi>as much reaſon for adoring an Hoſt truly conſecrated as there is for ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Diuinity of Chriſt;</hi> it is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly true, wheras Faith teacheth vs that the Hoſt truly conſecrated is God and man, Ieſus Chriſt really preſent.

Hence it is, that though Chriſt did baptize the Apoſtles with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal immerſion of their Bodyes; as Ancient Authors do auerr, (if by three or one immerſion wee know not) though this manner of Baptizing by a total immerſion was practiſed by the firſt age; and ſome ages of the Church; and that wee do not

Some tyme, the Church commanded Baptiſm to be giuen with one immerſion, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereticks, that would not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze but with three: to ſignify that the three Perſons were of different Natures. Thus you will find that in the 50. Canon of the Apoſtles three immerſions are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; in the 4. Council of Toledo, but One: S. Gregory writing to S. Leander, ſayes it may be adminiſtred either of both wayes: and laſtly the Church in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that many Infants eſpecially in the Northren Kingdoms through the Coldneſs of the Climat, dyed by the total immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Bodyes, commanded the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament should be adminiſtred with the ſprinkling of ſome principal part of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41955:122"/>Body with water; and this manner is vſed, alſo by the Proteſtants; who do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the Church for omitting the triple immerſion practiſed by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Euchariſt wee muſt diſtinguish the eſſence of it, from the circumſtances: <hi>That</hi> conſiſts in eating and drinking the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood, either vnder Accidents of bread alone, or wine alone, or bread and wine together; this is indiſpenſably requiſit: to neither in particular did Chriſt oblige vs, but left it arbitrary to the Church to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min as tymes, and iuſt occaſions required: and that Chriſt did not oblige vs to any of thoſe different manners: in particular, but left it arbitrary to the Church; firſt the text it ſelf declares it, for when he gaue the Cup, he did not abſolutly command the vſe of it ſaying <hi>Do this in commemoration of me,</hi> but, <hi>Do this, as often as you shall drink, in commemoration of me;</hi> which is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Drinking, but when wee shall drink, to do it in commemoration of him. Secondly wee haue a poſitiue example of Chriſt himſelf, that once gaue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the accidents of bread alone, to his diſciples in the way towards Emaus: wee haue no poſitiue example in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that Chriſt should baptize ſom tymes by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41955:123"/>ſprinkling the Body with water, ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by one total immerſion, and yet wee confeſs, that Baptiſm may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred any of theſe three wayes, as the Church shall ordain; wee haue no poſitiue example that Chriſt should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue giuen the Euchariſt, ſometymes in Leuen, ſometymes in Azim bread; and yet the Church may giue it in either: and hauing a poſitiue example that he gaue the Sacrament once in bread and wyne, and once, at leaſt, in bread alone, why cannot wee conclude that the Church may do ſo alſo. Chriſt gaue the Sacrament at night; is it therefore it cannot be giuen in the morning? Chriſt gaue it after the corporal repaſt; is it therefore it cannot be receiued faſting? Chriſt washed his Apoſtles feet when he gaue it, is it therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re needfull to wash the receiuers feet?</p>
               <p>That <hi>non obſtante</hi> of the Council of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ſo much ſurpriſes poore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, as if the Council had been preſumptious in prohibiting the vſe of the Chalice, hauing confeſſed that Chriſt and the Apoſtles gaue it to the faithfull, argues nothing of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; for as the Council knew that Chriſt and the Apoſtles gaue the Cup to the Layty, ſo it knew alſo that ſometymes they
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41955:123"/>gaue only the Bread, and therby did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it was left in the power of the Church to giue the Sacrament in either of both kinds. Vpon this ground did the Council of Conſtance, and does the Church now prohibit the Chalice, iuſt reaſons mouing them to it. Firſt, that if the Cup should be giuen, that would hinder the frequent Communion, to which the Church doth exhort vs much; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the wine is ſcant and deere, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municants thouſands in number; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences would be great: ſecondly People would conceiue a horror againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, if they were obliged to drink out of the ſame Cup with ſickly Perſons, perhaps with contagious diſeaſes. Thirdly the Communion would be morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to many, that can not endure the taſt of wyne. Fourthly the danger of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſome drops in a great multitude of Communicants, theſe and many other reaſons haue moued the Church to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the vſe of the bread alone.</p>
               <p>Heere indeed comes very pertinently M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls argument againſt the real Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. The Communion vnder both kinds is not needfull; neither for the verifying of Chriſts words in the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41955:124"/>nor for the effects, which by it are conueyed vnto vs: not for the effects conueyed, wheras what Chriſt promiſed to the Receiuers of the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>Cup,</hi> he promiſes to the Receiuers of the <hi>bread</hi> alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. <hi>He that eats this bread shall liue for euer,</hi> Io. 6.38. which he repeats three tymes in that chap. is not this all that is promiſed to the Receiuers of the Bread and Cup? not for the verifying of Chriſt his words, for that text Io. 6. (which is the ſtrongeſt that our aduerſaryes can alleadge) <hi>if you do not eat the flesh of the ſon of man and drink his blood you shall not haue lyfe in you.</hi> The particle <hi>and,</hi> which ſeems to require the taking of the Cup, as well as the bread, Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 25. and Suar. in 3. par. diſp. 71. ſect. 2. do manifeſtly proue that it muſt be vnderſtood <hi>diſiunctiuly,</hi> and ſignify <hi>or,</hi> and the ſence of the text is, <hi>if you do eat the flesh of the ſon of Man or drink his blood, &amp;c.</hi> And that in the Hebrew or Syriach language, (wherin Chriſt did ſpeake) it ſignifyes ſo, and that the Apoſtle S. Iohn writing in Greek, retained the Hebrew Phraſe,, Now that the particle <hi>and</hi> which vſually is <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulatiue,</hi> ſomtymes in Scripture ſignifyes <hi>diſiunctiuly,</hi> they proue it by ſeueral exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Scripture, as when S. Peter was

               <p>But ſay you Chriſt Mat. 26. after giuing the bread, and commanding to <hi>Eat,</hi> gaue the Cup and ſaid, <hi>drink ye all of this.</hi> If the Apoſtles only, were commanded to <hi>drink,</hi> they only were commanded to <hi>eat,</hi> and ſo as the Layty is excluded from <hi>drinking,</hi> they muſt be alſo excluded from <hi>eating:</hi> and if the command of <hi>eating</hi> did reach to the Layty, the command alſo of <hi>drinking</hi> did extend to them.</p>
               <p>For to anſwer this Obiection, you muſt obſerue the difference betwixt a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:41955:125"/>and a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> a ſacrifice is a worship of God by the oblation of ſome viſible thing which wee offer in homage of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that a ſacrifice is directed <hi>to</hi> God, and conſiſts in an <hi>Action</hi> exhibited to his honour A <hi>Sacrament</hi> is a ſenſible ſign giuen <hi>to</hi> a Creature for ſome ſpiritual inuiſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo that the Nature of a Sacrament conſiſts in the <hi>Reception</hi> of a viſible ſign by Gods Creatures; and is directed <hi>to</hi> them for a ſpiritual effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Euchariſt is a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Its a ſacrifice of Chriſts body and blood vnder the Accidents of bread and wyne, offered to God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Chriſts body ſacrificed on the Croſs; and that the repreſentation should be full and compleat, it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in bread to ſignify his body broken for vs, and in the liquid ſpecies of wyne to repreſent his blood effuſed. This ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is offered not only by the Prieſt, and for the Prieſts that conſecrats but <hi>by</hi> and <hi>for</hi> the whole congregation; but becauſe each Perſon of the multitude is not the immediat Miniſter of the ſacrifice, but all do offer it by the hands of conſecrated Perſons, on whom Chriſt layd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend of ſacrificing, <hi>Do this in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me,</hi> commanding them to do, as then
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41955:125"/>he did; it is not need full that each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the congregation should receiue, either the <hi>bread</hi> or the <hi>vvyne</hi> conſecrated, as it is a ſacrifice; but that the immediat Miniſter who offers it for all, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue both. Hence I confeſs that Chriſt in the inſtitution of this Sacrifice in the laſt ſupper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directed his commands of <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> only to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors; which he then conſecrated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Sacrifice; and that neither the word <hi>Drink</hi> nor <hi>eat</hi> in thoſe texts extend to oblige the Layty.</p>
               <p>But the Euchariſt is alſo a Sacrament, for that very body and blood of Chriſt, which he ordained to be a ſacrifice to God vnder the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of bread and wyne, he ordained them to be giuen vnder the ſame Accidents to man for the ſpiritual nourishment of his ſoule. I ſay <hi>vnder the ſame Accidents,</hi> not that both kind of Accidents of <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>vvyne</hi> are needfull for the perfect receiuing of a Sacrament but <hi>either;</hi> for the Euchariſt in the Accidents of bread alone, is a ſenſible ſign containing the body and blood of Chriſt, which nourishes the ſoul and giues lyfe euerlaſting, <hi>He that eats this bread shall liue for euer</hi> therefore its a perfect Sacrament: whence I conclude, that ſince it is giuen <hi>to</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:41955:126"/>Creatures as a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and not as a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> its ſufficient they receiue vnder the ſenſible ſigns either of bread alone or wyne alone; for in either its a perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and only in both a perfect Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. If you ask where then (if not in the words of the laſt ſupper) was there any obligation layd on vs to receiue the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt Sacramentally? I anſwer, Io. 6. if you do not eat the flesh of the ſon of Man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall concludes, that by Suarez his confeſſion, 3. p. diſp. 42. ſ. 1. the Accidents of bread and wyne are the conſtitutes of the Sacrament: conſequently by taking away the Cup, wee depriue the Layty of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Suarez ſayes, that the Accidents of bread and wyne, and either of <hi>bread</hi> or <hi>vvyne,</hi> are conſtituts of the Sacrament, and throughout the whole diſput. 71. largely proues in three ſections that the whole eſſence of the Sacrament is contained in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind.</p>

The Diuins after this Council diſpute, what adoration is it that muſt be exhibited to them: ſome ſay
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41955:128"/>only a <hi>Relatiue,</hi> others, an <hi>Abſolut</hi> Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſome ſaye an Adoration of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria improperly</hi> and for Gods ſake, to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me only a proper <hi>Latria</hi> is due; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that ſpeake of this <hi>improper Latria,</hi> are checkt by others, becauſe though by ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical ſubtilities they may be vnderſtood in a Catholick ſenſe, yet that expreſſion ſounds harsh to pious eares, and generally all Diuins do cenſure any that should out of the ſchool propoſe thoſe ſubtilities to vulgar eares. But what they all agree in, and wee belieue, that they muſt not be adored with that Adoration, wherwhith God is adored, and wee all ſay with <hi>Epiph.</hi> who was preſent at that Nicen Council: Act. 6. <hi>non indignas habemus ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines honore veneratione ac ſalutatione, debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamque adorationem illis dare debemus, ſiue igitur (obſerue</hi> theſe words) <hi>placebit adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, ſiue ſalutationem appellare; idem erit, modo ſciamus excludi Latriam; haec enim eſt alia, a ſimplici adoratione. vvee iudge Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vvorthy of honor and adoration, and vvee ought to exhibit it to them: call that adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you pleaſe, ſo it be not Latria, its all alyke vvhat you call it: for Latria is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from an ordinary and ſimple adoration.</hi> Let ſome particular Diuins therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

                  <hi>Petauius,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>agreat Antiquary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that for the four firſt Centuries there vvas little or no vſe of Images, in the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes of Chriſtians;</hi> I cannot imagin, to what purpoſe does M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sall</hi> bring theſe quotations of Petauius, Azor, Iacobus de Graffys, if it be not to let his Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or Reader know, that he is verſed in Authors. This proues that the Primitiue Church, did vſe Images, though not ſo much as now they do: and Petauius giues in that very place Dogm: Theol. to 5. l. 15. cap. 13. the reaſon, why they were not more frequently vſed; becauſe the world conuerted from Paganiſm, that belieued in ſtocks and ſtones, and ſome of them, that their <hi>Gods</hi> were <hi>Bodyes</hi> and not pure <hi>Spirits;</hi> to shun the occaſion of a relaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe errours, and to withdraw the people from any apprehenſions of <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> in God, Images were but little vſed, nay in ſome places where the danger was greater they were abſolutly prohibited; and Sanderus l. 2. <hi>de cultu imaginum</hi> c. 4. ſayes this was the reaſon why the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41955:129"/>of <hi>Elibert</hi> prohibited the vſe of Images. S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> whoſe words you cite, would haue the people, kept from an Idolatrous worship of Images and pretended no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. Not only <hi>Nichephorus Calixtus,</hi> but many this day of the Catholick Church do hold it abſurd to paint Images of the <hi>Father, ſon</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as they are in their proper ſubſtance and Nature; nor does the Catholicks vſe it as you falsly criminat them, but they paint the <hi>Father</hi> in the form of an Ancient Man, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Prophet Daniel, the <hi>ſon</hi> in human shape, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Doue as he appeared in the Riuer Iordan.</p>
               <p>Vaſquez ſpeaks not a word of Images in the place cited by you 3. p. diſp. 94. but 3. p. Diſp. 103.5.4. he ſayes Images alſo, as well as Idols, are prohibited in the firſt Commandment: and what then? Vaſquez was miſtaken as well as you: but you far more; for he ſayes in that place, it was not becauſe the adoration of Images was in it ſelf naught, as you ſay; for you ſay its Idolatry; but becauſe it was obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious in thoſe tymes to the danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Idolatry; and therefore prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited: but this danger ceaſing (as in the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41955:129"/>Law of Grace, Images may and ought to be adored, and not prohibited by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: if he ſpeaks conſequently or no its not my buſineſs to examine it. You ſay God commanded the Braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to be broken, becauſe the people worshiped it: 2. Reg. 13.4. but the text will inform you well, if you ſet preiudice aſyde, that they began to adore it for God, as they did the molten Calf: and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it was prohibited. You ſay our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commits many diſorders in adoring I mages; y deny any ſuch abuſes that may reach to Idolatry: and that the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which God has giuen to gouern vs, and which wee are bond to obey, is to take cogniſance of that, which when they do, and prohibit Images, wee will obey them; in the mean tyme wee will giue you and your Church leaue to bark at the Moon.</p>
               <p>But I muſt mind you of one mistake for to conclude this diſcourſe, Clemens Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrinus, ſay you, Hom. 7. (I pray whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re haue yow ſeen, or any other, Homilies of Clemens Alexandrinus? but this is not the miſtake that I am to aduertiſe you of) and in his Paraeneſis, ſpeaking of Images in general declareth thus: <hi>vvee haue no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in the vvorld, it is apparently forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41955:130"/>to vs, to exercyſe that deceitfull art for it is vvritten &amp;c.</hi> you are miſtaken M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sall,</hi> and it cannot be but maliciously, if you haue read his <hi>Paraeneſis,</hi> for he does not ſpeake of Images <hi>in general,</hi> but of Idols, and ſuch as were adored for Gods by the Gentiles, to whom he directed that <hi>Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> diſſwading them from Idolatry, to the worship of one true God. This is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, let the Reader peruſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf, and he will find that you are miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Hence wee conclude that Images of Chriſt and his ſaints cannot be called <hi>Idols.</hi> For an <hi>Idol</hi> is a repreſentation of a God that is not, or a <hi>Deyty</hi> that has no being; Images of Chriſt and the ſaints are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of things that haue a real <hi>Being:</hi> and to ſay that Chriſt his image is an <hi>Idol,</hi> is to ſay, that Chriſt, who is the Prototy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe has no real <hi>Being.</hi> wee conclude that the making of Images was neuer prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for God made man to his own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, commanded many Images to be made; the Ark of the Teſtament, the Braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſeueral others mentioned in Scripture: and the Proteſtants them ſelues make many Images of Kings, Queens, and ſaints. wee conclude, that all worship to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41955:130"/>Images is not prohibited for wee worship the King particularly, becauſe he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Gods Power and greatneſs; nor all <hi>religious</hi> worship of Images is prohibited, for wee giue a Religious worship to the Holy name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> to the Bible beyond all other Books, becauſe it is the word of God, and the Proteſtants to the Sacrament, which they ſay is but a figure of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Reaſon proues wee ought to worship the Images of Chriſt and his ſaints; for it is apparent, that there is ſuch a relation and connexion, betwixt the image and the thing wherof it is an image, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or deshonor don to the image for being a repreſentation of the Prototype, is eſteemed to be don to the Prototype: as when a man is by publick iuſtice burnt in <hi>Effigie</hi> his perſon is branded by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution don in his image, and no man but will think the iniury don to his picture, an affront to his own perſon. wee therefore muſt worship the Images of Chriſt and the ſaints, becauſe they are their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in this vndoubtedly wee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, for the relation and connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is betwixt the repreſentation and thing repreſented: this worship reſteth not in the Image, but paſſes to the Prototype
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41955:131"/>for whoſe ſake wee worship it. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it may be called a <hi>tranſitiue,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue</hi> worship; The adoration of <hi>Latria</hi> due to God wee deny to Images, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it as much as you: and when wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our Doctrin and Faith ſo cleerly, its malice and knowen preiudice, to accuſe vs of Idolatry, which conſiſts in adoring as God, what is not God.</p>

Peter Act. 4.12. that there is no ſaluation in any other, and no other Name vnder Heauen, wherby wee may be ſaued; all which wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and yet Proteſtants as well as wee do ask the prayers of their Brethren on earth; and why may not wee aske the prayers of the Saints in heauen? for what
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41955:134"/>wee expect by their interceſſion, and the value and worth of their prayers, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether grounded, and ſprings from the Merits of that name of Ieſus. This is all that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall alleadges againſt this Tenet of ours, iugde you what ſtrong conſiderations mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to deſert our Church. He ads the folly of two Spanish fryers that beyond all meaſure, <hi>euen of the Catholik Principles,</hi> as he grants, pag. 75. exceeded in the prayſes of Saints, and he would be no longer a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, ſince there were ſuch madmen amongſt vs, and perhaps ſome Proteſtants will haue the lyke encouragement for to leaue that Church, ſince M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall is entred into their Congregation. But if, by your acknowledgment, theſe exceſſes are againſt our Principles; therefore you grant, that our Principles do not wrrant any exceſſes in the Inuocation of Saints; why therefore did you leaue the Church, whoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ſound? becauſe ſome fryers played the foole? a pretty reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now that I haue anſwered your obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall; y pray anſwer me to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; that the Saints in Heauen do pray for vs, I proue it thus; and, if I be not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, euidently in the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:41955:135"/>
               <p>The Saints in Heauen know euidently that there is a Militant Church on earth, for they euidently know that the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or general Iudgment is not as yet come; wheras they know that they haue not aſſumed their Bodies; conſequently they know the world is not ended, and that there is a militant Church on earth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they know euidently that this militant Church is in continual warfare, ſtill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by Satan with temptations, beſet with ſpiritual dangers: for this is the <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi> of a <hi>Militant</hi> Church; and in this it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguished from the <hi>Triomphant;</hi> that <hi>This,</hi> is out of all danger; <hi>That</hi> is in continual battle: by this it appeares that the Saints in Heauen, are not altogether ignorant of our affaires on earth, as our Aduerſaries would haue them to be. Now I proceed in my diſcourſe, can it be imagined that the Saints in Heauen, knowing our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and battles with ſo fierce an enemy as Satan, should be ſo deuoid of Charity, as not to pray for vs? I know not what you may anſwer, but I know what ſome anſwer: that they can not pray; for, being rauish'd with the poſſeſſion of an acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht Bliſs, they cannot mind any thing els, but the glory of the obiect which they
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41955:135"/>ſee. But this is in credible, that the Deuils in the bitterneſs of their torments should not forget vs, nor the hight of miſeries should not allaytheir malice, but ſtill tempt vs; and the ſaints and Angels should abate their Charity in the greatneſs of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: ſpecially that Chriſt (ſayes S. Paul Rom. 8.) prayes ineſſantly for vs; the poſſeſſion therefore of the glory, cannot hinder the ſaints prayers for vs.</p>
               <p>But I proue that their glory obliges them to pray for vs: you cannot deny, but that in the poſſeſſion of that glory, they ardently deſire, the exaltation of Gods name, the increaſe of his glory, the confuſion of his enemy Satan; and what greater confuſion of Satan, what greater exaltation of Gods name and glory, than the victory of men againſt Satan, the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of thoſe that are tempted by him, and finally mens ſaluation; vndoubtedly then, wheras they euidently know that the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church is in continual battle againſt that enemy, in continual temptations, and dangers of damnation; the very poſſeſſion of that glory makes them deſire ardently, and wish our victoryes, and ſaluation: this wish and deſire of theirs, you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that it is manifeſt to God; and what
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41955:136"/>els, I ask you, is a Prayer, but <hi>a pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of a thing, repreſented to God?</hi> it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therefore that the ſaints and Angels pray for vs to God.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe, you will ſay, proues that the triumphant Church, and each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of it, knows the wants of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church in general, but not of each particular, or of any particular perſon of the Militant Church, therefore wee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons ought not to pray to any of the Triumphant Church, wheras they do not know if wee pray, or any of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affairs.</p>
               <p>But the argument proues at leaſt that the ſaints departed and Angels are Mediatours for the Militant Church in general; and ſo all M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls diſcourſe, for the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourship of Chriſt, falls to ground: more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I will proue by Scripture and reaſon that they know the temptations, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of particular Perſons of the Militant Church and conſequently the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe proues, that they pray for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, and heare their prayers.</p>
               <p>Lu. 15. its ſaid that the Angels reioyce at (and conſequently know) the conuerſion of a ſinner; the Deuils know the ſtate and condition of particular perſons, and by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41955:136"/>their temptations allures them to ſin: the glorious Spirits therefore, who in their natural knowledge are equal to, and in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural ſurpaſſe them, do know no leſs; neither is it credible that God should permit the Deuil to know mans condition to tempt him, and should not permit the glorious Spirits, eſpecially our Angels kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to help and defends vs: the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ought not to queſtion this; wheras in their Common Prayer Book, they haue this Collect on S. Michael the Archangels day the 29. of Sept: <hi>God vvho in a vvonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner diſpenſeths the Miniſteries of Men and Angels, grant, that as they do thee conſtantly aſsiſt in heauen, ſo by thy appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they may ſuccour and defend vs on earth.</hi> God therefore vſeth the Miniſtery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to help men, and conſequently Angels know mens particular affairs. That there are witches in the world may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, if wee will not condemn moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths of folly and iniuſtice, which punish many for ſuch, and if wee will not laugh at Scripture which relates 1. Reg. 28. that Saul by the help of a witch rayſed the Spirit of Samuel; that the witchs inuoke and are heard by the Deuils its out of doubt; and shall the Glorious Spirits be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41955:137"/>deaf to them that inuoke them? laſtly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples are recorded in Scripture of the miniſtery exhibited by Angels to men. 3.19.6. Reg. 1. Gen. 48.16. and 16.4. Reg. 19.34.</p>
               <p>And that ſaints alſo departed know our affairs and do aſſiſt vs, the Scripture doth witneſs it: Saul, all fraught with afflictions, finding no comfort in the liuing, betooke himſelf to the Spirit of Samuel deceaſed, 1. Reg. 28. this proues that men in thoſe dayes did belieue that the ſaints <hi>departed</hi> know our aflairs, and can help vs, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels anſwer to him does euidence the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Elias departed this world, thats to ſay all commerce with human kind, the 18. yeare of Ioſaphas Reygn, as appears 3. Reg. 22. and 4. Reg. 2. and 3. Ioſaphat dyed about ſeauen years after, which was the 25. yeare of his reygn, as appears 3. Reg. 22. Ioram ſucceeded to Ioſaphat, and Elias that departed from all human com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce ſeauen years before, writ a letter to him, rebuking him for his wickedneſs, and threatning him with Gods indignation. can there be amore manifeſt proof that the ſaints departed know our affairs, and do help vs? S. Peter 2. epiſt. c. 1. tells the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to whom he writ, that his death was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41955:137"/>at hand, and that he would be mindfull of them after his departure from lyfe, and help them to be mindfull of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin.</p>
               <p>Can it then be doubted but that wee may prudently, and ought to pray to them, by whoſe means the Scripture aſſures vs that others did receiue Gods bleſſings? ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directing our prayers immediatly to God, praying that for his B. Mothers ſake, for S. Peters ſake, for Dauids ſake (this prayer is often made by the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in Scripture, <hi>Propter Dauid ſeruum tuum non auertas faciem Chriſti tui.</hi> Pſal. 131. <hi>Memento Domine Dauid &amp; omnis manſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis eius.</hi> pſ. 131.) he would haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of vs? or directing our prayers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to the ſaints and Angels, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to help vs, and pray for vs; as Iacob Gen. 48. prayed that God, in who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſight he walked, and the Angel, who deliuered him from euils, should bleſs his children. This is it that's vnderſtood in that Article of our Creed, <hi>The communion of ſaints,</hi> that the ſaints of the <hi>Triumphant</hi> Church in heauen, of the <hi>Militant</hi> on earth, and the <hi>Patient</hi> in Purgatory, haue a Communication of prayers and merits betwixt them, that thoſe of heauen pray
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41955:138"/>for vs, and wee by our prayers and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, do help them in Purgatory.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sall</hi> thinks it extrauagancy, that wee call the B. virgen our <hi>Sauioreſs</hi> and <hi>Redeemer;</hi> and if he be impartial he muſt call the Prophet Dauid extrauagant alſo, when he ſayes (ſpeaking of the ſaints) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. <hi>I haue ſaid, ye are Gods, and the ſons of the higheſt all:</hi> And perhaps he will not ſtick to blame God himſelf, who ſayes to Moyſes Ex. 7.1. <hi>behold I haue made thee a God to Pharaoh?</hi> wee call the B.

To them we build Churchs for his ſake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are his great ſeruants. He aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res vs in the Ghospel that what wee do to one of his <hi>little ones</hi> wee do it to him; much more wee may be aſſured, wee do to him and for him, what wee do to, and for his ſaints in heauen, wheras him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tells vs, Io. 12 26. <hi>if any vvill ſerue me,

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41955:139"/>from Gods ſight: alſo its of Faith that they are tormented by fyre: but the Church has not determined, what kind of fyre is that, or how it torments; and though Diuins and Fathers ſpeake of other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet its no Article of Faith, that they ſuffer this or that, of Cold, ſnow or tempeſt.</p>
               <p>To proue our Catholick Tenet, I will firſt proue; that there is ſome other rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacle of Souls departed beſids Heauen and Hell of the Damned; ſecondly I will proue that there is a Purgatory.</p>
               <p>The firſt is proued by the Article of our Creed, <hi>he deſcended into hell,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderſtood to be the Hell of the damned, for all Chriſtians abhorr the blaſphemy of Caluin that ſayes Chriſt his ſoule ſuffered the payns of the damned: the Proteſtants giue a moſt obſcure inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to that cleer text; by the word <hi>Hell,</hi> ſay they, is vnderſtood the <hi>Graue</hi> and the ſenſe of the Article is, that Chriſt his Body deſcended into the graue. This is moſt abſurd, for in the next word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Article, the deſcent of his Body to the Graue is expresly declared, <hi>He vvas crucified, dead, and buried:</hi> to be buried what elſs is it, but his Body to deſcend
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41955:139"/>into the Graue? and after telling vs in the word <hi>buried,</hi> that his Body was put in the graue, would they again repeat the ſame in a diſtinct Atticle, when they pretended ro giue vs a brief abridgment of the article of Faith?</p>
               <p>S. Peter expounds that Article, 1. ep. 3.19. <hi>Being dead in flesh, he deſcended in Spirit, to the Spirits that vvere detained in priſon, to preach to them that vvere incredulous in the dayes of Noe.</hi> Behold the Article of our Creed expounded; <hi>his Spirit deſcended af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death,</hi> ſurely it did not deſcend into the graue) <hi>to the Spirits that vvere detained in priſon;</hi> (there was a priſon therefore, where Spirits were detained;) and <hi>preached to them,</hi> (certainly he did not preach to them that were in the priſon of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;) therefore there was ſome other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beſids that of the damned, where ſpirits were detained.</p>
               <p>Wee find Gen. 37.35. that Iacob per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by his children that his ſon Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph was killed, and deuoured by a Beaſt, lamented and ſaid, <hi>I vvill deſcend mourning vnto my ſonne to Hell.</hi> Certainly he did not intend to deſcend vnto him to the graue, for he was perſuaded he had none, but was deuoured by a Beaſt; neither can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41955:140"/>that he intended to deſcend vnto him, to the Hell of the damned, or belieued that his ſon deſcended thither; Iacob there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belieued that there was an other Hell, where his ſon deſcended, and he expected to goe after his death. This shocks the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le fabrick of the Proteſtant doſtrin, of <hi>no Purgatory;</hi> grounded chiefly on the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of no other receptacle of ſouls, but Heauen and Hell of the damned.</p>
               <p>Now that there is a Purgatory, I proue it: the Proteſtants deny it, becauſe that if the ſin be forgiuen in this lyfe, then all the punishment due of man for that ſin is alſo forgiuen, and ſo there is no Purgatory: if the ſin was not forgiuen, then it carries the ſoul to Hell, for in the other world no ſin is forgiuen. But I proue that though the ſin be forgiuen by the Sacrament, or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſome temporal punishment is due of the ſinner to God, to ſatisfy his iuſtice, is it not the dayly practice of Preachers, to exhort ſinners, euen the reconciled ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to do pennance, for their ſins? what pennance did not Magdalen do, euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Chriſt had told her, that her ſins were forgiuen? what great pennance did not Dauid, S. Peter, and other reconciled ſinners do? this shews that the Faithfull we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re allways perſwaded that pennance muſt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41955:140"/>be don, though the ſin be forgiuen: and it is no aſwer to ſay, that theſe auſterityes pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by them were not for the ſins they committed, and were forgiuen; but for to arm them againſt future temptations; for wee haue many paſſages of Scripture which shews punishments inflicted by God on the reconcilied ſinners, for their ſinns, after they were forgiuen.</p>
               <p>For example original ſin is forgiuen by Baptiſm, yet the corporal death, which is a punishment inflicted on mankind for that ſin, as S. Paul ſayes Rom. 6. and 5. is not forgiuen, but inflicted on all. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Nathan declared to Dauid that his ſin of Adultery was forgiuen him, yet in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of that ſin, the Child got by that Adultery, should dye. 2. Reg. 12 Iask, was that puuishment iuſtly due of Dauid after his ſin was forgiuen or no? If not, why should God inflict it for that ſin? if it was due; let vs ſuppoſe that Dauid had dyed before that punishment was inflicted, (which might haue happened, and dayly happens to others; who dye before they do any pennance for the ſins that by the Sacrament were forgiuen) ſurely he muſt haue paid that debt in the other lyfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could enter into Heauen; where
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41955:141"/>no ſoul, guilty of any thing, can enter. Therefore there muſt be ſome other place where ſinners, whoſe ſins haue been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, and that haue not don ſufficient pennance in lyfe muſt be punished in the other world. A Priſon I ſay where the laſt farthing may be paid, and that being paid, the priſonner may get out, for our Sauiour mentions ſuch a priſon after this lyfe. Mat. 5. and Luc. 12. but the laſt farthing cannot be paid in the Hell of the damned, for the debt is due there, for <hi>Eternity;</hi> therefore there muſt be ſome other priſon for ſouls departed beſids the Hell of the damned.</p>
               <p>Now if you read M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Salls diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vpon this ſubject, you shall not find that he brings any text of Scripture, that as much as ſeemingly ſayes there is no Purgatory; and yet the Reformers did ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus from the Church of Rome, wherof they were members, vpon pretext of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (wherof Purgatory is one) which they would proue by cleer Scripture to be errours, and contrary to Gods written word: and not one text does M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, nor can he bring any cleer text to proue <hi>no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;</hi> much leſs will you find any euident, or conuincing reaſon in his diſcourſe to impugn our Tenet: what he does is to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41955:141"/>anſwer ſom texts (the chief he ſayes, but he is miſtaken) wherwith Bellarmin proues it, and giues only Bellarmins own anſwers, and thus he would perſwade vs out of our Doctrin.</p>
               <p>But firſt allow thoſe texts that Bellarmin brings, do not conuince the exiſtence of a Purgatory; allow that texts which I heere alleadge, do not manifeſtly proue it: This, no man of iudgment will deny, but that theſe texts and gloſſes vpon them, haue as much probability, as much appearance of truth, as any that you bring or can bring againſt Purgatory: that your anſwers to thoſe texts are not euidently true, for they are Bellarmins own anſwers, for the moſt part at leaſt, and he reiects them very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, ſince therefore wee were for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages in the actual belief of the doctrin, before you and your Reformers came to the world, why shall wee be bet from it, if you cannot shew ſtronger reaſons or texts againſt it, than wee haue for it. Nay though wee brought no reaſons at all to proue our doctrin, but this that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it as the word of God from ſo many precedent ages; is it reaſon that for you, or your Reformers pleaſure, without a conuincing text or reaſon to proue it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41955:142"/>wee muſt diſclaim it? allow that thoſe texts do not cleerly proue Purgatory, thats nothing; wee are not <hi>Actors</hi> but <hi>Defendants,</hi> its not our obligation to proue, but yours; wee will defend ourſelues againſt your proofs, and ſo hold our old doctrin.</p>
               <p>But now I proue that thoſe texts, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall iudges inconcluſiue, do proue what Bellarmin intended the firſt is out of 2. Mach. 12. a collection being made, he ſent 12000. drachmas of ſyluer to Ieruſalem, to haue ſacrifice offered for the ſins of the dead becauſe he did conſider that theſe, who receiued death with piety, would haue a very good reward it is therefore a holy and holſom thought, to pray for the dead, that they may be deliuered from ſinns. This is the text though theſe Books were Canonical Scripture, ſayes he, yet the text proues not Purgatory, for prayers for the dead, may be made for other ends, than that of drawing ſouls out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; firſt becauſe that God being ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all ſpaces of Eternity, foreſeeing now, what prayers will be made many years and ages hence, for perſons that are now, at this preſent, dying, and being a good Paymaſter that oftentyms giues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, the rewards of what ſeruices
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:41955:142"/>will be don for the future, may now giue to the perſon dying the aſſiſtance of his grace and mercy, which he foreſees will be in future tymes asked for them by friends that will pray for them: which Doctrin, ſayes he, is taught by the Romish writers, and acording to this Doctrin wee may ſay, that the effect of thoſe prayers made for the Iewes by <hi>Iudas Machabeus,</hi> was not do draw them out of Purgatory after thy were dead, but that God should haue giuen them for reward of thoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers a Good death.</p>
               <p>Obſerue, Reader, what is it that Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min intended to proue by that argument, l. 1. de Purg. c. 3. §. <hi>ad ſextum dico</hi> he ſpeaks thus. Our conſequence proceeds not thus: <hi>they prayed for the slain; therefore there is Purgatory:</hi> but thus. <hi>They praied for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of the ſins of the dead:</hi> therefore they iudged, that after their death they might be in Purgatory; that they might after death haue ſome ſins that needed expiation: and this praying for the dead, to deliuer them from ſin after their death, is commended by Scripture: conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins may be forgiuin after death, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is a Purgatory after death, otherwyſe the Scripture would haue erred
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41955:143"/>in prayſing, prayers for the remiſſion of the ſins of the dead. And what man of common ſenſe does not ſee, that theſe concluſions follow out of that text. For what Bellarmin pretended and wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to proue out of that paſſage, is that it was the practice of the Iewish Church, and the belief of the People of God (and conſequently no new inuention of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church) that ſins may be expiated and forgiuen after death and that prayers were vſed to be made for the dead, not only for to prayſe God, for the reſt of the Faithfull departed, nor for the mutual comfort of the liuing in the death of our friend, nor for our ſpiritual inſtruction reflecting on our own mortality at the ſight of death, but as this text expresly ſayes, <hi>for the ſins of the dead, that the dead may be deliuered from their ſins.</hi>

               <p>That ſubtility of the Catholick Doctors alleadged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, that God foreſeeing the prayers that will be made, may, as a good Paymaſter, pay before hand, is very good, but is not to the purpoſe: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe prayers made for the slain might haue had that effect in this paſſage, but ſtill returns the concluſion, pretended by Bellarmin, that the paſſage proues it was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41955:143"/>the belief and practice of the People of God, and prayſed by Scripture, to pray for the expiation of the ſins of the dead. Moreouer it might, and does, lykely, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that ſome dye for whom no prayers are or will be made after death, which our foreknowing God cannot reward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, becauſe they are not in <hi>Being</hi> nor will not; if thoſe men dye in venial ſin, or without hauing don ſufficient pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, there muſt be a Purgatory for them, conſequently that ſubtility proues not the <hi>non Exiſtence</hi> of a Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Again, ſayes he, that paſſage, though true, proues not Purgatory, becauſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Men dyed in mortal ſin, wheras they were found to haue vnder their coats things conſecrated to the Idols. (As the text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates (nor is it true, ſayes he, what Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin ſayes, that their ſin was only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, becauſe it deſerued Gods vengean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and their death: as if a venial ſin, did not de ſerue that punishment. Neither does Bellarmin ſay abſolutly it was but a venial ſin, but that <hi>perhaps</hi> it was no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was committed through ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or though it might be mortal, yet at the hour of death, eſpecially dying for ſo pious and glorious a cauſe, they might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41955:144"/>obtained of God an act af contrition. And wheras Iudas Machabaeus did not know certainly that they were guilty of Motal ſin, he might haue prayed for them.</p>
               <p>He alleadges other conſiderations why prayers might be made for the dead, though there were no Purgatory, firſt for to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe God for the reſt giuen to the departed, ſecondly for our mutual comfort in the death of our friend, thirdly for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to mind vs of our mortality, and ſayes that when in Ancient Authors wee meet prayers to be made for the dead, wee muſt vnderſtand, they were made for the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ends, and not for the drawing of ſouls out of Purgatory. wee confeſs that thoſe conſiderations are very good, and that they were practiſed by the Ancient Church (as thoſe words of the Commentaryes vpon Iob, futhered on Origen relat) and are ſtill practiſed, but wee deny that theſe are the onely conſiderations for praying for the dead but alſo for the remiſſion of their ſins, as the former text doth euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; for their eaſe and deliuery from the payns they ſuffer after death: and in the Ancient Fathers wee meet (contrary to what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall auers) prayers for the dead to be made for this end: nothing more
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41955:144"/>frequent: two examples only I will produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: S. Denis, Diſciple of S. Paul Apoſtle, I. de Ecc. Hierar. c. 7. p. 3. <hi>the venerable Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop approaching prayes for the dead, and that prayer beſeecheth the Diuine Clemency, that he may forgiue to the dead, all the ſins that through human fraylty he committed: and that he may place him in the light, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the liuing.</hi> Iſidorus l. 1. de off. Diu, c. 18. <hi>if the Catholick Church did not belieue that ſins are forgiuen to the Faithfull depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it vvould neither make alms, nor offer ſacrifice to God for their ſouls.</hi> This is the vnanimous Doctrin of all antiquity, to all which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall will anſwer with Caluin, Gchinus and Peter Martyr that the Ancient Fathers erred: and this is all the anſwer wee can expect.</p>
               <p>He values nothing the text out of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias 4. alleadged by Bellarmin, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues cleerly what Bellarmin pretended, that it was the practice of the People of God, to offer alms for the dead. The words <hi>fyre</hi> and <hi>vvater</hi> (ſayes he) in the pſ. 66.12. <hi>vvee paſſed through fyre and vvater, but thou brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghteſt vs out into a vvealthy place.</hi> ſignify tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and croſſes of this lyfe, and ſo that text proues nothing of Purgatory. Bellarmin aknowledges, it might be thus
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41955:145"/>interpreted, and in other ſenſes, but ſayes Bellarmin, <hi>Origen Hom.</hi> 25. <hi>in Num. and S.

               <p>Bellarmin brings the words of Chriſt Mat. 12. that <hi>a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, shall not be pardoned in this vvorld nor in the vvorld to come.</hi> And ſayes that S Auguſtin, S. Greg. Beda, and S. Bernard, draw from this text a conſequence that ſome ſins are pardonable in the other world, nay that this was the only text wherwith S Bernard did proue Purgatory.

                  </gap> Sall ſayes that conſequence does not follow, becauſe, ſayeth he, (he taketh this reaſon from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr) a poſitiue does not follow out of a negatiue, as from ſaying, <hi>the Duke of venice is not Earl of Dublin,</hi> it follows not, <hi>therefore ſome other is Earl of Dublin.</hi> See you Reader, which interpretation you ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke beſt if you will chooſe to ſtick to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, and Peter Martyr, or to S. Auguſtin, S. Greg. Bede, and S. Bernard. His exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is friuolous. For it were a ridiculous
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41955:145"/>propoſition to ſay, <hi>the Duke of Venice is not Earl of Dublin,</hi> if there were not a Dublin extant wherof ſome one may be Earl; ſo it were ridiculous to ſay, <hi>this ſin shall not be forgiuen in the other vvorld itſelf:</hi> if there were not an other, world where ſins may be forgiuen; therefore wee ſay, that either wee muſt acknowledge ſins to be pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the other world, or Chriſt his words to be ſence leſs: as it were a ſence leſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, to ſay, <hi>pride shall not be punished in this vvorld, nor in Heauen.</hi> When all the world is perſwaded before hand, that Heauen is no place of punishment for pride or any other vice. So wee alſo grant, that were wee to conſider the letter only of the text; out of the words of the Euangeliſt, Mart. 1.25. wee ought to conclude that Ioſeph knew Marie after her Chilbirth; but the Scripture interpreted by the Church expounds vnto vs by ſeueral other texts the ſence of that text not to be, as the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter founds; and Mary to haue remayned a Virgen continually; and ſo you bring that text to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall I will proue, that not only acording to the rule of Prudence, but alſo acording to the rules of Faith and Logick, the conſequence of Purgatory, is manifeſtly
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41955:146"/>euinc'd out of that text: Thus ſayes the text: <hi>He that vvill ſpeake a vvord againſt the ſon of Man, it shall be forgiuen him; but he that vvill ſpeake againſt the H. G. it shall not be forgiuen him, either in this vvorld, nor in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> I argue thus: the text denies to a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy againſt the H. G. what it grants to a blaſphemy againſt the ſon of Man. But what it denies to <hi>That,</hi> is remiſſion in this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe and the other: therefore what it grants to <hi>This</hi> is remiſſion in this lyfe, and the other: The text ſayes again in this place. <hi>Euery ſin and blaſphemy shall be forgiuen to men, but a blaſphemy againſt the H. G.</hi> Is it nor an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſequele out this text, that as a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Spirit is vnpardonable ſo all other ſins are pardonable; but a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Spirit is vnpardonable in this world, and in the future; therefore other ſins are pardonable in both.</p>
               <p>You will reply, that this argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues too much; for it proues that as a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the H.G. is vnpardonable in the other lyfe, not only as to the <hi>punishment,</hi> due to the ſin, but alſo as to the <hi>guilt,</hi> or <hi>fault;</hi> ſo other ſins are pardonable in the other lyfe, not only as to the <hi>punishment</hi> due to ſin, which is what wee pretend; but alſo as to the <hi>fault</hi> or <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin; which is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41955:146"/>more than wee pretend; for wee teach that Mortal ſins are not forgiuen as to the <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>fault,</hi> in the other world: therefore this argument proues too much. Anſwer: that a ſin may be ſaid <hi>vnpardonable,</hi> its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit that <hi>Nothing</hi> of it be pardonable; for, as the ſchoole Maxim ſayes <hi>Negatio totum deſtruit:</hi> wheras therefore the text imports, that a blaſphemy, againſt the H. G. is <hi>vnpardonable</hi> in this lyfe and the futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, it follows, that nothing either the <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>fault</hi> of it, or <hi>the punishment</hi> due to it, be pardoned, either in this lyfe or the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But that a ſin may be ſaid <hi>pardonable</hi> it ſuffices that ſome part of it at leaſt may be pardoned; wheras therefore our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proues, that ſins are pardonable in the other lyfe, its requiſit that ſome part of it be pardoned or pardonable in the other lyfe; either the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin, or the <hi>punishment</hi> due to it: Not the <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>fault;</hi> as wee belieue and proue by many euident arguments: therefore the <hi>punishment</hi> due to it.</p>
               <p>He tells vs the doctrin of Purgatory makes men negligent of true repentance, and ſatisfaction for their ſins in this lyfe, for the hopes it giues of the Remiſſion of them in Pugatory. But this is incredible, that men
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41955:147"/>being inſtructed of the bitterneſs of the torments of Purgatory, far exceeding all that can be ſuffered in this world, should be encouraged to omit the ſmale pennan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and pains of this lyfe, for to fuſſer the far greater and more exceſſiue pains of Purgatory. It giues (quoth he) occaſion to pittifull abuſes of <hi>Simony</hi> in the valuation of <hi>Maſſes,</hi> of cruelty and iniuſtice: and what is there in the world ſo ſacred and Holy, but the malice of man may abuſe? is it therefore all ſacred things muſt be renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and abolisht? wee condemn the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as well as you; but wee muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemn the Doctrin, but correct the malice of man that abuſes it.</p>
               <p>From this of Purgatory he deſcends to exclaim againſt Indulgences; which he pretends to be groundleſs becauſe Suarez, <hi>l. de Defen. fid. c.</hi> 15. ſayes that Indulgences is a remiſſion of the pains of Purgatory, and moſt falsly auers that Suarez doubts, if this power be in the Church, wheras in that place he affirms it is vndoubtedly certain the Church has it, and grounds this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty on the infinitneſs of Chriſts Merits, which euen our Aduerſaries grant, and on the power giuen to the Church, Mat. 18.18. of binding and vnbinding; which power
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41955:147"/>ſayes he, cannot be doubted, but it extends to the Remiſſion of the pains of Purgatory; for which in that place he brings no other proof but the conſtant practice of the Church, which he ſayes is an vnqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof; and remits the more ample proof of this doctrin to <hi>To.</hi> 4. <hi>in</hi> 3. p. <hi>diſp.</hi> 48.</p>

               <p>You ſay the doctrin of Indulgence is not ſo Ancient: and that the firſt who began to giue theſe Grants was <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeauenth, to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him and the Chriſtians to warr againſt the Sarazens; as Baronius relates an. Dom 1084. if all this were true; its older notwithſtanding than Proteſtancy by many hundred years: But if you haue no more skill in Diuinity or Moral Theology, (your Treatiſe shews well what you know in Controuerſy) than you ſeeme to haue in Hiſtory, you are but a fresh water ſcholler. That Indulgence you ſpeake of, nor no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to any ſuch purpoſe, was not granted by <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeauenth, but by <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſecond; nor to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de no warr againſt the Sarazens, but to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; not in the yeare 1084 but 1095. Neither is this the firſt grant of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences which you could meet, if you had read the Hiſtories; Baronius related by
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41955:148"/>you, tells vs that Indulgences were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Leo the third the yeare 847. and by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Eight the yeare 878. Nor is it a good argument; <hi>vve do not read that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences vvere giuen before; therefore the Povver of granting Indulgences vvas not in the Church before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You add that priuat Bishops granted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences for gathering of Monies to build Churches; that is very true, but if <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> was built vpon that account, is not ſo certain: by that you may ſee Indulgences are not ſo slightly granted as your Miniſters do perſwade their flock; but on Condition that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers endeauor to put them ſelues in the ſtate of Grace by true repentance of their ſins, and that they exercyſe ſome pious works of faſting, Prayers, Alms, deeds, and ſuch others as they, who giue the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, require: and that the Alms which are enioyned in ſuch caſes (though by the malice of ſome they may be turned to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vſes) are deſigned for pious vſes. You mention ſome words of the 92. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Council of Lateran, vnder Innocent the Third, and that Council has but 70.

               <p>You cite S. <hi>Thom.</hi> and S. <hi>Bonauen.</hi> who relate, ſome were of opinion, that <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were but a pious fraud of the Church to draw men to charitable Acts; its true tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſaints relate that opinion; but relate not who were the Authors of it; but only <hi>that ſome did ſay ſo,</hi> and they condemn it as impious, and iniurious to the Church.

And do not you do the lyke? wee embrace moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly the aduertiſment of Bellar de amiſs: Gratiae l. 6. which you relate (but nothing to your purpoſe) that in things depending of the freewill of God, wee muſt affirm nothing but what he has reuealed in his Holy Scripture; but you are miſtaken in aſſerting that God has not reuealed the Doctrin of Indulgence in the Scripture, for that text Mat. 18.18. <hi>vvhateuer ye shall vnbind on earth, shall be vnbinded in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> ſignifyes the Power of vnbinding from

And though there were no text in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that either explicitly or implicitly did import Indulgences in particular; yet by Scripture it ſelf wee are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it, it being the Doctrin of the Church, as S. Auguſt: ſaid of Hereticks Baptiſm l. 1. cont. Creſcon. c. 32. and 33. oBſerue his words, which comes very appoſitly to our preſent ſubiect: <hi>Although verily there be brought no example for this Point</hi> (he means the validity of Heretick Baptiſm, for which he ſayes there is no text in Scripture) <hi>yet euen in this Point the truth of the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is held by vs, vvhile vvee do that, vvhich
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41955:150"/>the Authority of Scripture doth recommend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: that ſo, becauſe the Holy Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceiue vs, vvho ſoeuer is afraid to be deceiued by the obſcurity of this queſtion, muſt haue recourſe to the Church Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning it, vvhich vvithout ambiguity the Holy Scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend vnto vs.</hi> By which ſentence of S. Auguſtin, you find that wee follow Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whylſt wee follow the Doctrin of the Church, which the Scripture commands vs to heare and obey.</p>
               <p>You will perhaps infer out of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a conſequence, which may ſeem to you abſurd, thus: therefore wee are bound to belieue as an Article of Faith, what Doctrin the Church propoſeth to vs, though that point in particular be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained either explicitly or implicitly in any text of Scripture, only vpon the teſtimony of the Church: This conſequence is true: and the reaſon is; that the Church, being Gods infallible Oracle, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not propoſe to vs as a reuealed Truth but only that Doctrin, which truly is reuealed by God: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed all Truths of Religion to the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les as wee haue diſcourſed in the 6. Chap. the Apoſtles deliuered all thoſe truths to the Church, to be handed from age to age to Poſterity; the Apoſtles did not deliuer all
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:41955:150"/>thoſe Truths in writing, as wee haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in the 2. and 3. ch. but part in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and this is <hi>Scripture,</hi> part by vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Tradition, and this is the <hi>Depoſitum</hi> that S. Paul ſpeaks of to Timothie, the Church is the keeper of this <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> and as by the Scripture wee know what written Truths the Apoſtles deliuered; ſo by the Church wee know aſſuredly what vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Truths they deliuered. Now wee ſay that the Church cannot propoſe to vs as a reuealed Truth, but what was deliuered by the Apoſtles (who doubtleſs knew and taught to their Diſciples all truths of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) to the Church, for wee do not ſay nor belieue, that the Church can coyn new Articles of Faith, but only deliuer the Old, that, through careleſsneſs, came to be confuſedly knowen, and almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; wee do not pretend that the Church has new reuelations of new Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, which God did not deliuer to his Apoſtles, but that she has the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit to know certainly, and find out the truths that were formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed and taught by the Apoſtles, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in writing but by word of mouth. what truths therefore the Church propoſes vnto vs, wee are obliged to belieue them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41955:151"/>truths, though they be not in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re particularly mentioned; for if they be not there, they were taught verbally by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, they are of Apoſtolical tradition, and if the tradition be obſcure or doubtfull, the declaration of the Church renders it certain. Thus it matters not that Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is not expreſſed, nay nor implicitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture; if it be not, it muſt of neceſſity haue been taught verbally by the Apoſtles, ſince that the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this Doctrin as a reuealed Truth, and no truth is a reuealed truth, but has been reuealed to them, and by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto their Diſciples.</p>

The Hearer is God properly, and not the Cougregation; and therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re there is no Congregation preſent, the Pſalms are ſung in the Oyre and Publick ſeruice don: if therefore wee communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat our fence (when wee ſay Maſs or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick ſeruice) to God, who is the hearer wee ſatisfy the purpoſe that Nature intends by ſpeaking, and wheras God vnderſtands our fence in whateuer language wee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke though vnknowen to the Congregation; wee may ſay the publick Prayer in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage vnknowen to them.</p>
               <p>Is not Prayer, ſay you, (you ſee how your arguments recoyls againſt yourſelf) a raiſing vp of our minds to God to prayſe him or ask fauors of him? will it not be conducent and neceſſary for this to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Pſalms and Prayers? But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> do you think it neceſſary that a Polander, who preſents a Petition to the King of England in the English language, ought to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe he does not himſelf vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that language? or is it not enough for his purpoſe, that the King doth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41955:152"/>it? cannot he prudently rely in the Faith and honeſty of the Notary or Clerk that writ it, who being inſtructed of what he pretends giues him the petition drawen to be preſented? If therefore Prayers, by your acknowledgment, are but our requeſt to God for the obtaining of his Mercy, is it not ſufficient for me that he vnderſtands them? and may not I rely on the Faith, and honeſty of the Church, who giues me the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Prayers, as ſo many petitions wherin my requeſt is contained?</p>
               <p>You bring a text of S. Paul 1. Cor. 14.17. againſt this Tenet, and you will not haue vs to conſider the obiect or end to which he directed his diſcourſe; but the reaſons and inſtances he alleadges: as if his reaſons, or any mans reaſons, could be of force to proue any thing, but in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the obiect, or ſubiect of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. To the contrary, for to vnderſtand the Apoſtles reaſon in the genuin fence, wee muſt obſerue to what end he directed his diſcourſe, and the ſubiect he treated of; and no vnpreiudiced man will reade that Chapter, but will manifeſtly preceiue that he did not ſpeake of Prayers to God, but of preaching and inſtruction of the congregation, which he ſome tymes in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41955:152"/>that Chap. calls <hi>Prayer,</hi> but the context shews plainly, that what he meanes is <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> or <hi>inſtruction</hi> of the people: for all a long he diſproues that <hi>Praying</hi> or <hi>ſpeaking</hi> in an vnknowen language; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Hearers</hi> did not vnderſtand it: does not this reaſon appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently proue that he meant what was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto the people, which was what wee now call <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>exhortation?</hi> For S. Paul could not condemn Prayers made to God in an vnknowen language, and giues that for reaſon, <hi>becauſe the Hearers did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it:</hi> for the <hi>Hearer</hi> of the Prayers made to God, are not the people but God, to whom the prayer is made; and of him, S. Paul could not ſay, that he did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: therefore he could not condemn ſpeaking to him in an vnknowen language.</p>
               <p>To be brief; I propoſe this ſyllogiſm. S. Paul in that Chap. condemned ſpeaking in a language that the Hearers could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; this is euident out of the tetx. But in the publick Prayer of the Church, wee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake to God, he only is the Hearer of thoſe Prayers, for to him they are made and directed and not to the people, and he can vnderſtand in any language: therefore S. Paul did not condemn the publick Prayer
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41955:153"/>of the Church in any language. Again S. Paul condemned ſpeaking in an vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen language, that the Hearers, to whom one did ſpeake, did not vndeſtand: But in the Church nothing is ſpoken to the people, but what is preached, or taught by exhortations, ſermons, expoſition of the Ghoſpell, &amp;c. then, and only then, the Congregation are the <hi>Hearers:</hi> therefore what S. Paul condemned was preaching exhorting, or expounding the Ghoſpell vnto the people in vnknowen languages, becauſe then the Hearers could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what was ſpoken to them.</p>
               <p>He tells vs what great bleſſings the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants enioye by hauing the Publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in Common language, how much it conduces for the increaſe of deuotion and how vnhappy the Catholicks are in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this comfort; but, alas, wee haue but too great an experience of the contrary; that the putting the Lyturgy in common language, has cauſed the decay of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the contempt of the publick ſeruice, the deſreſpect of ſacred things ſullyed by euery Coblers mouth; your men of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and zeale are ſufficiently ſenſible of this, and would wish that theſe ſacred things were kept at a diſtance from the common people.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:41955:153"/>
               <p>The words of S. Auguſtin, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>de doctr. Chriſt. c.</hi> 10. that he thinks do fauor him, proues what wee teach, <hi>vvhat profiteth any excellency of ſpeech, if not vnderſtood by the Hearer?</hi> (when wee pray, God is the <hi>Hearer,</hi> and he vnderſtands any language: and when wee preach or exhort, the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is the <hi>Hearers,</hi> and muſt ſpeake to them in the language they vnderſtand) <hi>No cauſe being for ſpeaking, if vvhat vve ſpeake be not vnderſtood by them, for vvhoſe ſake vvee ſpeake, that they may vnderſtand vvhat vvee ſpeake.</hi> Could he ſpeake in plainer terms of a preacher? to let him vnderſtand that he muſt preach in the language that his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory vnderſtands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Antiquity of their practice</hi> (of praying in the Latin language) <hi>goes thus,</hi> ſayes he: and when I expected he should tell vs when it began; (for this would be to declare the <hi>Antiquity</hi>) he bids that task farewell, and only tells vs the motiue and cauſe why it was introduced; not becauſe the Latin or Greek were more Holy than other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but becauſe they were more vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally vnderſtood: and do you approue that reaſon? if not why do not you ſay ſom what againſt it; if you do? why therefore do you check the practice?</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:41955:154"/>
               <p>Now let vs briefly shew the lawfullneſs of praying in an vnknowen language, (I ſay the Publick Prayer of the Church as for priuat prayers, its confeſſedly lawfull and commendable to pray in vulgar language) and the neceſſity of it. The Lawfullneſs is proued The Iewish Church had their Publick ſeruice in the Hebrew language, which was not vnderſtood by the People, the common language was the ſyriak: And Chriſt hauing aſſiſted ſomtymes at their Publick ſeruice, as wee find in the Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, though he reprehended often the abuſes of that Church, neuer did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this, by what wee may gather out of the Euangeliſts: nay he publickly approued it for when he hung on the Croſs exercyſing the function of a High Prieſt in the ſacrifice of his lyfe for mankind he prayd publickly <hi>Eli Eli Lammaſabacthani</hi> which being Hebrew, was ſo far from being vnderſtood by the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they thought he called for Elias. Therefore it is lawfull in the publick Sacrifice and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of the Church to pray in an vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen language. Moreouer its not neceſſary that the people vnderſtand the Prieſt or Miniſter who prayes, as the publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Church, for the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41955:154"/>how many of your Congregation that do not vnderſtand agreat part of your pſalms, though they be in vulgar langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge? many Phraſes of them being ſo hard and obſcure, that the learned Men muſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the help of Interpreters to find out their true meaning: And the Deaf, and ſuch that are at ſo great a diſtance that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare, do not they reape any benefit by your publick Prayers becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vnderſtand what is ſaid? And if a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot of France came to Dublin, who did not vnderſtand your language, would not you admit him to your Communion and publick ſeruice? by this you ſee its lawfull of its ſelf, to make publick Prayer in an vnkwnowen language.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, and I belieue the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church will pretend no more, that it is not ſo conuenient for the edification of the people; but more needfull, it should be in the language that is commonly vſed. To this I anſwer that the Publick Prayer of the Church may be in any language which is thought the moſt conuenient for the glory of God, and ſpiritual profit of the flock; but I ſay alſo, that it is not you, or I, or this, or that kingdom or Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce muſt be the iudge to determin in which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41955:155"/>language is it moſt conuenient it should be; God has giuen vs a Church who will gouern vs, its to her it belongs to iudge what Rites, Ceremonies, and manner of Diuin worship wee muſt practiſe, and as the particular ſubiects of each Kingdom, cannot queſtion the Cuſtoms, Lawes, or Decrees of the Gouernment, ſo the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Kingdoms and Prouinces muſt not queſtion, nor iudge of the conueniency of what Rites or practice the Church does eſtablish; let vs ſuppoſe that in relation to this kingdom of Ireland, it might be thought, and realy may be ſom what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re aduantagious for the flock, to haue the Publick ſeruice in English or Irish, is it therefore it muſt be lawfull for this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without the approbation of the Church or ſuprem Paſtor of it, to vſurp that practice? no, but you are to repreſent that conueniency to the Church, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce to her reſolution. But ſay you why would the Church of Rome ſtick on ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a thing as that; but rather than to be a cauſe of Schiſm or ſeparation, grant the publick ſeruice may be in vulgar language? and I ask alſo, why would not you, or this Prouince, or that rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content to want that particular comfort
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41955:155"/>which you propoſe to yourſelf in doing this or that which is not conformable to the approued practice of the Church, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to run in deſobedience againſt the Church whoſe command and Authority, is a ſufficient warrant for you to allay what ſcruples your reaſon may ſuggeſt againſt it? The Church ought not to condeſcend with you, and diſpenſe with you in the obſeruance of the publick practice and Ceremonies; though they be but bccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and human inſtitutions: for if it shoud grant you lycence to ſay Maſs in English, why should it not grant France leaue to Communicat in both kinds, if France did ask it: and if Spaine did ask to Chriſtean with three immerſions of the Body and not otherwyſe why should not the Church grant it; and if Germany did ask the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Clandeſtin Marriages, why should it be denyed; and ſo (each Kingdom, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their reſpectiue priuiledge) the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in Diuin ſeruice, Adminiſtration of Sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Eccleſiaſtical Rites ſo much commended in the Church, would be quite ouerthrowen.</p>
               <p>Its the Church therefore muſt iudge and determin in what language is it moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to worship God by Publick Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:41955:156"/>and wee are to acquieſee to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and commands of the Church. And therfore <hi>Luther,</hi> who vnder pretence of greater conueniency and ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the congregation condemned Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick ſeruice, in vulgar languages, againſt the practice of the Church; ſchiſmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated himſelf from her; in which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration you continue by adhering to his Doctrin.</p>
               <p>The Church eſtablished Publick ſeruice in the Latin language; behold why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the common language of the Church: as in reſpect of England English is the common language, and ſpanish in reſpect of ſpaine; ſo in relation to the Church ſpred throughout all Nations, the Latin is the moſt vniuerſal and common. Therefore it was conuenient the Publick Prayer of the Church, which is ſaid in all parts, should be in the publick and moſt vniuerſall language which is the Latin. And as each kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has a language proper to it ſelf, ſo the Church which is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, has its proper language which is Latin; which is ſo vniuerſally knowen. Secondly for to preſerue vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the manner of Diuin worship; if the Maſs had been in English three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41955:156"/>yeare agon, how different would the Maſs be now from what it was then? the language being wholy an other, from what then is was: doubtleſs, it would haue cauſed great alteration in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick ſeruice. Thirdly if the Maſs were not in Latin or ſom language vniuerſally knowen throughout the world, but in the particular language of each kingdom, when Prieſts would come from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to ours in Pilgrimage, (or for other occaſion,) they would not be premitted, (or not without great difficultie) to ſay Maſs, and ſo would be depriued of that ſpiritual Comfort.</p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41955:157"/>counſels, than, by pretending to know more than behoueth, to run into thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniencies, wherin you haue fallen. You accuſe the Catholick Church for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Images to the adoration of the flock, for the danger of falling into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and this is the reaſon that Caluin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo giues: you haue liued many years in Spain, where Images are in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: you haue been much acquainted with the Inquiſition, as you would haue vs belieue; you know the ſeuerity of that Tribunal againſt Hereticks, Iewes and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters; how many haue you ſeen in ſpain, that by adoring Images came to fall into Idolatry? doubtleſs had there been any, the Inquiſition would haue taken holt of him; for though the Inquiſition permits Images, it would neuer leaue Idolatry, occaſioned by the adoration of Images, vnpunished. And not one, I dare ſay, did you euer ſee, or heare of, to haue been punished on this account.</p>
               <p>Now conſider, how many haue fallen into Hereſies, and errours quite oppoſit euen to your Church, by the liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for reading of Scripture; hence has proceeding all the Sects that are in our kingdoms and elswhere. Does not this
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41955:157"/>demonſtrat, that there is far greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Hereſy in the vſual reading of the Bible, than of Idolatry in adoring of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? ought not you rather therefore, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the liberty of reading the Bible, than the adoration of Images?</p>
               <p>But, reply you, this proues that euen the Prieſts and fryers ought to be kept from reading it, for its they that haue abuſed it, and broached all hereſies: and things muſt not be prohibited (that are in themſelues good) becauſe they are abuſed but the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers muſt be punished: And this good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, will not perſwade you to admit the vſe of Images: wee grant M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall that principle to be good, that things, in themſelues commendable, muſt not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, becauſe they are abuſed; when the vſe of then is abſoluty needfull, or conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; and the abuſes are not very frequent and pernicious; as in this caſe of reading the Bible; its not needfull, nor can it be proued to be very profitable for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people; on the other ſyde the abuſes are moſt apparent, frequent, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; for thence comes all theſe ſects and hereſies; therefore it ought to be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, you muſt mind, what I aduertiſed you in my diſcourſe of Prayers
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41955:158"/>in an vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n language, that it is not you or I nor any other, but the Church, that muſt iudge of the conueniency or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniency, the aduantage or deſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of reading of Scripture; she muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that, and acording what she iudges, who is conſtantly directed by Gods infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit in the gouernment of the flock, muſt permit or prohibit it.</p>
               <p>This, your Church will not ſay, that the vulgar people are bound in conſcience to read the Scripture; for many cannot reade any thing; others do not read all Scripture, nor do they think that they ſin, by not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; others do neuer read any thing of it: what you can iuſtly pretend is, that it is conuenient and profitable, and therefore ought to be permitted: and heere returns what I diſcourſed of Praying in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen tongue. Let any vnpreiudic'd man iudge if it does not belong to the Church to determin, what is conuenient, or moſt conuenient; ſince that God has giuen a Church to gouern vs? Let any man iudge, if a particular man, that againſt the eſtablisht authority, vnder which he liues, and is bound to obey; should riſe againſt that authority and make himſelf iudge of what is conuenient or inconuenient for
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41955:158"/>the gouernment, and vnder pretence of a greater conueniency that appears to him, should alter the eſtablished practices of the Commonwealth, should not ſuch a man, I ſay, be eſteemed a ſeditious Reuolter, and be punished? what therefore shall wee ſay of <hi>Luther?</hi> he liued vnder the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Catholick Church; he was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat perſon, he found the vſe of the Bible prohibited, and publik ſeruice in Latin; he did not pretend that it was abſolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſaluation, to pray in knowen languages, nor to reade the Bible; but iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it to be moſt conuenient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned the Church for prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it; is not this man to be eſteemed a ſchiſmatick, that oppoſes himſelf to the publick authority, and makes himſelf iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of the practices eſtablished by it? and muſt not wee rang you with him that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the ſame rebellion?</p>
               <p>Prieſts and fryers haue abuſed Scripture, its very true; but for one that has, thouſands haue not, and for one of the vulgar that has not, many haue: beſids prieſts and fryers, being the Paſtors of the Church, are obliged to reade, and when a Prieſt or fryer abuſes the Scripture, its eaſy to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him; but when a multitude of popular
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41955:159"/>people abuſes it, the remedy is not ſo neer at hand. He quotes vpon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stillingfleets word, a Council of Bishops at Bononia, that prohibited the Scripture giuing for reaſon that it diſcouers the corruptious of the Catholick Doctrin: but this Council muſt be of the ſame coyn of the 92 Canon of the Council of Lateran, which wee mentioned aboue, no ſuch Canon of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran or Council of Bononia is, or was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, but in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stillingfleet and Salls ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>I conclude with theſe two Aſſertions: firſt its needfull that the Paſtors, Prelats, and Doctors of the Church do reade the Scripture; and that the flock receiue from them the ſence of it, and the Doctrin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. Its for this end that God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his Church ſome <hi>Prophet,</hi> ſome <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> ſome <hi>Euangeliſts, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> to keepe vs in Vnity of Faith by teaching what wee ought to belieue S. Paul Eph. 4. Act. 20.18. he commands the Paſtors to watch ouer the flock, in which the H. G. hath placed them to gouern the Church. Its therefore Chriſt laid his command on the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, to teach all Nations, to preach the Ghoſpell: and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore ſayes S. Baſil. q. 25. <hi>Superiorum eſt iſta
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41955:159"/>ſcire, &amp;c. its the obligation of the Superiors (to ſay the Paſtors) to knovv and learn theſe thing, vvhich they may teach to others; but of the others, not to konovv more, than behoueth them to knovv.</hi> And Leo Pope writing to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarck of Alexandria epiſt. 62. and epiſt. 82. ad Iul. <hi>You muſt haue care that none, vvho is not a Prieſt of the Lord, may preſume to vſurp the authority of teaching or preaching, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a Monk, or a layman though a lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned man.</hi> And S. Aug. l. 1. de moribus Eccl. c. 1. <hi>vvhat man of iudgment doth not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the expoſition of Scripture, is to be asked of them, vvho by their profeſsion are their Doctors.</hi> And if to proceed wyſely, wee muſt conſult the Lawyers, for the true meaning of the Law, and that each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth hath men whoſe profeſſion it is to ſtudy it, and deliuer the true ſence of it, to thoſe that are not Lawyers by Profeſſion, how much more, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that there be Doctors in the Church whoſe obligation is to ſtudy the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and find out by the Fathers and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters the true ſence of it, and teach it to the people.</p>
               <p>This and no more doth the authorities of Fathers produced by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall proue; the reading of Scripture is recommended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41955:160"/>vs, ſayes he, by S. Baſil, S. Chryſoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and S. Auguſtin: its very true; but to whom? to the learned men of the Church, whoſe obligation it is to teach the Doctrin it contains, and to the Layty no further, than to hold that ſence of them, which the Paſtors deliuer to be the ſence of the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Aſſertion, that it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, nor lawfull for the Layty to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de them further, than with a total ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Iudgment to the ſence giuen to them by the Church. This is manifeſtly proued by the multitude of ſects, wherin to the world is deuided through the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty aſſumed of reading the Scriptures, and vnderſtanding them, as the Readers think beſt. Secondly by the obſcurity of Scripture which wee haue demonſtrated in the 2 and 3. ch. S. Peter, ſayes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sall,</hi> 2. Epiſt. 1.19. exhorts vs to read, <hi>vvee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue alſo a ſure vvord of of Prophecy, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runto ye do vvell to take heed &amp;c.</hi> but S. Peter, <hi>by that ſure vvord of Prophecy,</hi> means, not only the written word of God, but alſo the vnwritten word, which is the Tradition, by which the Church deliuers to vs the true ſenſe of the written <hi>vvord;</hi> which he bids vs <hi>to take heed of.</hi> S. Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:41955:161"/>defence of Doctrins repugnant to their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not eſtablisht by Catholick Faith; as may appear in their violence in forcing all to belieue and declare for the Conception of the Virgen Mary vvithout Original ſin, ſo many clear teſtimonies of Scripture being againſt it, as affirm that all Men did ſin in Adam; that Chriſt vvas vniuerſal Redeemer from ſin, and Sauiour of all mankind.</hi> And pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues complaning that none is permitted to preach in Churchs, or receiue Degrees in vniuerſities, but ſuch as will proteſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly for the immaculat Conception.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41955:162"/>the Virgen Mary was in ſin, or could not be Redeemed: but you ignore, or affect to ignore that there are two manners, or wayes of redeeming; the one deliuering a man from the ſin wherinto he has fallen, the other preſeruing him from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſin. Marie was redeemed by the Merits of Chriſt from ſin, becauſe by his Merits she was preſerued from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, wherinto she had fallen had she not been preſerued by him; and this is the moſt noble way of Redemption, as it is a greater benefit, to ſaue a man from being wounded, then to permit him to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and afterward to cure him.</p>

               <p>MOnſtruous errors you ſay, obliged you to a ſeparation from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, (the vain pretext of hereticks of all ages, whoſe Names she has crushed to infamy, ſtill Triumphant againſt the Gates of Hell) and I muſt belieue they were errors that obliged you; but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary only in her, and real in yourſelf we haue aſſerted her vnſpotted; and what renders you eternally criminal, is, that you know in your own conſcience, they were no errors of the Church, which you ſtile by that name: I ſay you know it well in your own conſcience; for you that was
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41955:166"/>ſo many years a Catholick, and a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor (as you ſay) in Scholaſtical and Moral Diuinity in Controuerſies, and what not? You could not but know that the Pop's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in temporal affaires ouer Princes, was no article of our Faith; but a School-queſtion denied by many Catholicks: you knew alſo the Pop's infallibility was but and opinion of ſom diuins and that what wee belieue as an article of Faith, is not the infallibility of the Pope alone (of which only you ſpeake) but of the Church Vniuerſal, as it is diffuſed, or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in the Pope and Council together, was it not then knowen malice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice that made you recken as errors of the Church, theſe points, which are not Church Doctrin? was it not wicked and damnable in you to ſeparat from her for errors (if they be ſuch) which are not her errors, but of ſome or many Doctors? which you could haue denied, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remain a Catholick, but oblige Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in refuting them!</p>
               <p>But you had a mind to depart, and to render your ſeparation more acceptable to our Aduerſaries, you tooke for pretence thoſe two points, which though you know well they were no points of our Religion,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41955:166"/>yet you knew they were very odious to our Aduerſaries, and them you reſolued to pleaſe vpon any account. was it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you exclaim againſt the Church of Rome ſaying tis but <hi>a part of the Church, and not the Church Vniuerſal.</hi> pag. 24. as if you did not well know, that wee do not pleade for the Bishoprick of Rome, and that wee do confeſs it is but <hi>a part</hi> of the Church.

Act. 5. in our Church Kings, Princes, Noble Men, and rich men haue followed this Doctrin: I confeſs many of our Church do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, but the quite contrary, but the Doctrin is not only practis'd by many, but the Church exhorts the Faithfull vnto it, and that to great effect, wheras our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents and Monaſteries are in habited by many who changed their plenifull eſtates for powerty, their Silks end ſattins for rags, their delicat dishs for a fryers portion, their liberty for retyrement, and their wordly pleaſures for a continual mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: you know this to be true, who knows the Order of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> to ſpeake nothing of other religious orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how much the Proteſtant Church is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to this Doctrin and practiſe, the world knows: what Proteſtant did you euer hear of, that forſook a plentifull eſtate to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com a poor Miniſter? did euer any Miniſter
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41955:169"/>or Preacher of your Church exhort his flock to this practiſe, or would not he be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Mad man, that would do it? How then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall? did you for to ſecure your ſaluation, chuſe that Church, where this Counſel of Chriſt is neglected, and which laughs at vs for following it? did you for to ſecure your ſaluation, forſake powerty which Criſt recommended as a means to be ſaued, and to which you were by <hi>ſolemn vovv</hi> obliged, and go to a Church where you may haue, and does expect to be rich, Chriſt hauing branded Richs as dangerous to ſaluation? This manner of ſecuring ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation was euer yet vnknowen to all Saints, who eſteemed Richs and Honors ſworn enemyes to the ſoule; they to ſecure their ſaluation, forſook Richs and Honnors, and you to ſecure yours, you forſake powerty (Powerty I ſay to which you are obliged by ſolemn vow) and ſeek for Richs.</p>
               <p>Had you changed the Catholick Religion for an other more auſtere wee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that your aim was to ſecure your ſaluation; for Chriſt recommended Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of lyfe, and the mortification of our flesh and ſenſes, as a moſt powerfull means for to ouercom vice. I doubt not but that there are many Libertins in our Church,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41955:170"/>who do indulge and cherish their Bodyes too much to the preiudice of their ſouls; but look to the Doctrin and Maxims of the Church; Pennance, auſterity of lyfe, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the Body is not only taught, as good and aduantagious to the ſoul, but is practis'd by innumerable Catholicks of all ſexes, ages and conditions in diſclplins, hair-cloaths, faſting sleeping on the bare ground ryſing at midnight for to prayſe God, abſtaining from delicat meats and wearing of Linnen and ſeueral other chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements of the Body; Chriſt has recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this auſterity of lyfe, and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mortifications by S. Paul 1. Cor 9.17. the great Baptiſt did practiſe them Mar. 1. the Prophet Dauid pſ. 148. S. Paul himſelf, and all the ſaints of the Primitiue Church; and the Church did euer yet eſteem theſe means very powerfull for to purchaſe virtue and ouercom vice; and you to ſecure your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, you haue forſaken the Church, where this Doctrin is taught, and practis'd, for the Proteſtant Church; did you euer heare of any Proteſtant, who diſciplins himſelf, who sleeps on the bare ground, who ryſes at midnight to ſing pſalms to God, who abſtains from wearing of Linnen? I do not wonder that many Libertins of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:41955:170"/>your Church, should ſet theſe exerciſes at naught, but that the whole Body of that Church by their Doctrin and Principles should condemn them, as fruitleſs, Idle, nay and iniurious to Chriſt's Paſſion: is this the Church M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, which you haue chuſen for to ſecure your ſaluation? a Church whoſe Doctrin is ſo carnal, which will not ſmart the flesh, but cherish the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? it's lykly indeed that your aim was, in your change of Religion, to ſecure your ſaluation; when you left a Religion where you in particular, were obliged to Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for a Religion, which obliges you to none, but to enioy pleaſures; a Religion where you were by vow obliged to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werty, for a Religion where you expect to be, and may be rich; a Religion where by your Profeſſion you were incapable of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, for one where you may haue Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. No M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sall, you will not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the world, that it was any aduantage to your ſoul which moued you: your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will appeare to any impartial man, to be uniuſt and damnable; and attended par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in you, by innumerable ſins; for though the Precepts of the Church, of faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, annual Confeſſion and Communion, and keeping Holy dayes, reach not to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41955:171"/>Proteſtants who are ſuch by education; but it's out of controuerſy that they oblige you, to whom her Power for commanding, and your obligation of obeying, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently knowen; wherfore there is not a faſting day which you infring, an Annual Confeſſion which you omit an Eaſter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that you neglect, or a holy day Maſs, but you commit a haynous ſin. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on theſe monſtruous effects of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and amuſe not your ſelf with the hopes that you will be of the number of them, who at the laſt hour will be reclaim'd, and call for a Prieſt to be reconcil'd. It's our duty to beſeech God he may be ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto you; but it's yours not to abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Gods patience, leaſt that in punishment of not anſwering now to his inſpirations, you may heare then thoſe dreadfull words of the Prouerbs ch. 1. v. 24. <hi>I haue called and ye refuſed-ye haue ſet at naught my Counſels, and vvould none of my reproof: I alſo vvill laugh at your calamity; I vvill mock vvhen your feare cometh-Then shall you call vpon me, but I vvill not anſvver, they shall ſeek me earneſtly, but they shall not find me, for that they had knovvledg and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord.</hi>
